The name is a mneumonic for the common features observed in SHORT syndrome that include; short stature, hyperextensibility of joints, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and teething delay. Other common manifestations of SHORT syndrome are mild intrauterine growth restriction, partial lipodystrophy, delayed bone age, hernias and a recognizable facial gestalt.",<1/1000000,The prevalence of SHORT syndrome is unknown. Less than 50 cases have been reported in the literature to date.,"Individuals with SHORT syndrome often display mild intrauterine growth restriction. Feeding difficulties and/or failure to thrive present in early childhood and final adult height is shorter than average (155-163 cm in males and 143-160 cm in females). Most patients have a characteristic facial gestalt, often described as progeroid, with triangular face shape, prominent forehead, ocular depression, hypoplastic alae nasi, low-hanging columella, downturned corners of the mouth, micrognathia and prominent (but not typically low-set or posteriorly located) ears. Partial lipodystrophy may be evident in the face at birth and later in the chest and upper extremities (including the hands), but it is usually not reported in the buttocks and legs. Delayed dentition, hypodontia, enamel hypoplasia, malocclusion and multiple dental caries are frequently reported. Ophthalmic anomalies (e.g. Rieger anomaly, Axenfeld anomaly (see these terms), glaucoma) are also characteristic of the disease. Diabetes is seen in approximately 2/3 of individuals with SHORT syndrome after the age of 15 years. Other less common manifestations include hyperextensibility of joints and/or hernias, sensorineural hearing loss and ovarian cysts in females. Intellectual development and cognition are usually unaffected although mild impairment with speech delay has been reported.","Treatment is symptomatic and requires a multidisciplinary team. Screening for insulin resistance is recommended starting in mid-late childhood. Glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus can be treated with diet, lifestyle, oral medication and insulin, while growth hormone therapy is contraindicated. Ophthalmological management and follow-up (i.e. regular eye examinations) are necessary to reduce and stabilize ocular pressures and to preserve vision. Dental anomalies can be treated using standard methods (e.g. crowns and dental prostheses).",,,,,,

Approximately 2/3 of patients are female.,"Age of onset peaks around 45 and symptoms develop over months or years. Progressive muscle stiffness renders the trunk and hips immobile, and the gait becomes stiff and awkward. Superimposed painful spontaneous or reflex-induced muscle spasms may cause serious falls. A specific fear of crossing open spaces (pseudo-agoraphobia) may induce freezing of gait, sudden spasms, and falls. Focal neurological signs are absent. Clinical variants of SMS include the stiff limb syndrome (SLS) where symptoms affect only one limb, and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) where stiffness and myoclonic spasms are associated with focal neurological signs. Many patients with SMS, SLS, or PERM have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (30%), autoimmune thyroiditis (10%), atrophic gastritis with pernicious anaemia (5%), and some have tumours of the breast, lung, or colon.","Benzodiazepines and baclofen are standard drugs for symptomatic treatment. Immunomodulating therapies (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis) have been proposed with variable results.

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

But symptoms worsen as anemia worsens.","Anemia occurs when your blood doesn't have enough red blood cells. This can happen if: Your body doesn't make enough red blood cells, Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replaced, Your body destroys red blood cells, What red blood cells do, Your body makes three types of blood cells — white blood cells to fight infection, platelets to help your blood clot and red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin — an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. Hemoglobin enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body and to carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to your lungs to be exhaled. Most blood cells, including red blood cells, are produced regularly in your bone marrow — a spongy material found within the cavities of many of your large bones. To produce hemoglobin and red blood cells, your body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from the foods you eat. Causes of anemia, Different types of anemia have different causes. They include: Iron deficiency anemia. This most common type of anemia is caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many pregnant women. It is also caused by blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer and regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin, which can cause inflammation of the stomach lining resulting in blood loss., , Vitamin deficiency anemia. Besides iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Also, some people who consume enough B-12 aren't able to absorb the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as pernicious anemia., Anemia of inflammation. Certain diseases — such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, Crohn's disease and other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases — can interfere with the production of red blood cells. Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when your body doesn't produce enough red blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and exposure to toxic chemicals. Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. A variety of diseases, such as leukemia and myelofibrosis, can cause anemia by affecting blood production in your bone marrow. The effects of these types of cancer and cancer-like disorders vary from mild to life-threatening. Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias develops when red blood cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase red blood cell destruction. You can inherit a hemolytic anemia, or you can develop it later in life. Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a hemolytic anemia. It's caused by a defective form of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent shape. These irregular blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells.","These factors place you at increased risk of anemia: A diet lacking in certain vitamins and minerals. A diet consistently low in iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases your risk of anemia. Intestinal disorders. Having an intestinal disorder that affects the absorption of nutrients in your small intestine — such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease — puts you at risk of anemia. Menstruation. In general, women who haven't had menopause have a greater risk of iron deficiency anemia than do men and postmenopausal women. Menstruation causes the loss of red blood cells. Pregnancy. If you're pregnant and aren't taking a multivitamin with folic acid and iron, you're at an increased risk of anemia., Chronic conditions. If you have cancer, kidney failure, diabetes or another chronic condition, you could be at risk of anemia of chronic disease. These conditions can lead to a shortage of red blood cells. Slow, chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within your body can deplete your body's store of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia., Family history. If your family has a history of an inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, you also might be at increased risk of the condition. Other factors. A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune disorders increases your risk of anemia. Alcoholism, exposure to toxic chemicals, and the use of some medications can affect red blood cell production and lead to anemia. Age. People over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia.","Left untreated, anemia can cause many health problems, such as: Severe fatigue. Severe anemia can make you so tired that you can't complete everyday tasks. Pregnancy complications. Pregnant women with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to have complications, such as premature birth. Heart problems. Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat . When you're anemic your heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood. This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure. Death. Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can lead to life-threatening complications. Losing a lot of blood quickly results in acute, severe anemia and can be fatal.","Many types of anemia can't be prevented. But you can avoid iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias by eating a diet that includes a variety of vitamins and minerals, including: Iron. Iron-rich foods include beef and other meats, beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, and dried fruit. Folate. This nutrient, and its synthetic form folic acid, can be found in fruits and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables, green peas, kidney beans, peanuts, and enriched grain products, such as bread, cereal, pasta and rice. Vitamin B-12. Foods rich in vitamin B-12 include meat, dairy products, and fortified cereal and soy products. Vitamin C. Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits and juices, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, melons and strawberries. These also help increase iron absorption. If you're concerned about getting enough vitamins and minerals from food, ask your doctor whether a multivitamin might help.","When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you're feeling fatigued and you don't know why. Fatigue has many causes besides anemia, so don't assume that if you're tired you must be anemic. Some people learn that their hemoglobin is low, which indicates anemia, when they donate blood. If you're told that you can't donate because of low hemoglobin, make an appointment with your doctor."

Etiologies of diabetes insipidus include deficiency of antidiuretic hormone secreted by the neurohypophysis, impaired kidney response to adh, and impaired hypothalamic regulation of thirst.","Hereditary central diabetes insipidus is a rare genetic subtype of central diabetes insipidus (CDI, see this term) characterized by polyuria and polydipsia due to a deficiency in vasopressin (AVP) synthesis.",,The prevalence is unknown.,"Symptoms usually develop between 1 and 6 years of age but onset in the neonatal period or in elderly patients has been described. They include polyuria, polydipsia and nocturia (often manifesting as enuresis in children). Additional symptoms seen in children can include: lethargy, irritability, growth retardation, weight loss, fever, vomiting or diarrhea. In the autosomal recessive form, symptoms are secondary to reduced biological activity of mutant AVP; heterozygous carriers have subclinical manifestations or are asymptomatic.",,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

The clinical presentation is highly variable and includes chronic or intermittent mild to severe abdominal pain associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, leading to maldigestion and/or pancreatic endocrine insufficiency (glucose intolerance progressing to diabetes mellitus type 3c) in some cases. The disease is slowly progressive. The risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma after the age of 50 is elevated in patients with HCP. However, the exact risk increase is difficult to assess.","Mainstays of medical management involve pain control, nutritional support, treatment for diabetes mellitus, and pancreatic enzyme supplementation for exocrine insufficiency. Surgery may be indicated for the management of acute and chronic complications of HCP and includes debridement, drainage, decompression and only very rarely pancreatectomy. Additional risk factors for chronic pancreatitis (smoking, alcohol) should be avoided.","Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis may vary, depending on which type you experience. Acute pancreatitis signs and symptoms include: Upper abdominal pain, Abdominal pain that radiates to your back, Abdominal pain that feels worse after eating, Fever, Rapid pulse, Nausea, Vomiting, Tenderness when touching the abdomen, Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms include: Upper abdominal pain, Losing weight without trying, Oily, smelly stools ","Pancreatitis occurs when digestive enzymes become activated while still in the pancreas, irritating the cells of your pancreas and causing inflammation. With repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis, damage to the pancreas can occur and lead to chronic pancreatitis. Scar tissue may form in the pancreas, causing loss of function. A poorly functioning pancreas can cause digestion problems and diabetes. Conditions that can lead to pancreatitis include: Abdominal surgery, Alcoholism, Certain medications, Cystic fibrosis, Gallstones, High calcium levels in the blood, which may be caused by an overactive parathyroid gland, High triglyceride levels in the blood, Infection, Injury to the abdomen, Obesity, Pancreatic cancer, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, a procedure used to treat gallstones, also can lead to pancreatitis. Sometimes, a cause for pancreatitis is never found.","Factors that increase your risk of pancreatitis include: Excessive alcohol consumption. Research shows that heavy alcohol users are at increased risk of pancreatitis. Cigarette smoking. Smokers are on average three times more likely to develop chronic pancreatitis, compared with nonsmokers. The good news is quitting smoking decreases your risk by about half, Obesity. You're more likely to get pancreatitis if you're obese. Family history of pancreatitis. The role of genetics is becoming increasingly recognized in chronic pancreatitis. If you have family members with the condition, your odds increase — especially when combined with other risk factors.","Pancreatitis can cause serious complications, including: Pseudocyst. Acute pancreatitis can cause fluid and debris to collect in cystlike pockets in your pancreas. A large pseudocyst that ruptures can cause complications such as internal bleeding and infection. Infection. Acute pancreatitis can make your pancreas vulnerable to bacteria and infection. Pancreatic infections are serious and require intensive treatment, such as surgery to remove the infected tissue. Kidney failure. Acute pancreatitis may cause kidney failure, which can be treated with dialysis if the kidney failure is severe and persistent. Breathing problems. Acute pancreatitis can cause chemical changes in your body that affect your lung function, causing the level of oxygen in your blood to fall to dangerously low levels. Diabetes. Damage to insulin-producing cells in your pancreas from chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes, a disease that affects the way your body uses blood sugar. Malnutrition. Both acute and chronic pancreatitis can cause your pancreas to produce fewer of the enzymes that are needed to break down and process nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea and weight loss, even though you may be eating the same foods or the same amount of food. Pancreatic cancer. Long-standing inflammation in your pancreas caused by chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer.",,"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent abdominal pain.

Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes.

There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1994.",<1/1000000,,,,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet.

You may notice: Excessive thirst, Frequent urination, Nausea and vomiting, Stomach pain, Weakness or fatigue, Shortness of breath, Fruity-scented breath, Confusion, More-specific signs of diabetic ketoacidosis — which can be detected through home blood and urine testing kits — include: High blood sugar level, High ketone levels in your urine","Sugar is a main source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and other tissues. Normally, insulin helps sugar enter your cells. Without enough insulin, your body can't use sugar properly for energy. This prompts the release of hormones that break down fat as fuel, which produces acids known as ketones. Excess ketones build up in the blood and eventually ""spill over"" into the urine. Diabetic ketoacidosis is usually triggered by: An illness. An infection or other illness can cause your body to produce higher levels of certain hormones, such as adrenaline or cortisol. Unfortunately, these hormones counter the effect of insulin — sometimes triggering an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common culprits. A problem with insulin therapy. Missed insulin treatments or inadequate insulin therapy or a malfunctioning insulin pump can leave you with too little insulin in your system, triggering diabetic ketoacidosis. Other possible triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include: Physical or emotional trauma, Heart attack or stroke, Pancreatitis, Pregnancy, Alcohol or drug abuse, particularly cocaine, Certain medications, such as corticosteroids and some diuretics","The risk of diabetic ketoacidosis is highest if you: Have type 1 diabetes, Frequently miss insulin doses, Uncommonly, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur if you have type 2 diabetes. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis may be the first sign that you have diabetes.","Diabetic ketoacidosis is treated with fluids, electrolytes — such as sodium, potassium and chloride — and insulin. Perhaps surprisingly, the most common complications of diabetic ketoacidosis are related to this lifesaving treatment. Possible complications of the treatments, Treatment complications include: Low blood sugar . Insulin allows sugar to enter your cells, causing your blood sugar level to drop. If your blood sugar level drops too quickly, you can develop low blood sugar. Low potassium . The fluids and insulin used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis can cause your potassium level to drop too low. A low potassium level can impair the activities of your heart, muscles and nerves. To avoid this, electrolytes, including potassium are usually given along with fluid replacement as part of the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Swelling in the brain . Adjusting your blood sugar level too quickly can produce swelling in your brain. This complication appears to be more common in children, especially those with newly diagnosed diabetes. Left untreated, the risks of diabetic ketoacidosis are much greater. Diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to loss of consciousness and, eventually, death.","There's much you can do to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis and other diabetes complications. Commit to managing your diabetes. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed. Monitor your blood sugar level. You might need to check and record your blood sugar level at least three to four times a day, or more often if you're ill or stressed. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level stays within your target range. Adjust your insulin dosage as needed. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to adjust your insulin dosage in relation to factors such as your blood sugar level, what you eat, how active you are, and whether you're ill. If your blood sugar level begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to return your blood sugar level to your target range. Check your ketone level. When you're ill or stressed, test your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter urine ketones test kit. If your ketone level is moderate or high, contact your doctor right away or seek emergency care. If you have low levels of ketones, you may need to take more insulin. Be prepared to act quickly. If your blood sugar is high and you have excess ketones in your urine, and you think that you have diabetic ketoacidosis, seek emergency care. Diabetes complications are scary. But don't let fear keep you from taking good care of yourself. Follow your diabetes treatment plan carefully. Ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.","When to see a doctor, If you feel ill or stressed or you've had a recent illness or injury, check your blood sugar level often.

Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes.

Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

The key clinical features include retinal degeneration , childhood obesity, sensorineural hearing loss, and normal mental development. Endocrinologic complications include type 2 diabetes mellitus; hyperinsulinemia; acanthosis nigricans; hypothyroidism; and progressive renal and hepatic failures. The disease is caused by mutations in the alms1 gene.","A rare multisystemic disorder characterized by cone-rod dystrophy, hearing loss, obesity, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and progressive hepatic and renal dysfunction.",1-9/1000000,Alström syndrome (AS) has a suggested prevalence of 1/1000000 in Europe and North America. A much higher frequency was reported in some populations with a high level of consanguinity or those that are geographically isolated. More than 950 cases have been identified worldwide.,"The clinical features, age of onset, and severity can vary greatly among and within families. Cone-rod retinal dystrophy usually develops within a few weeks after birth, with the first symptoms being nystagmus and extreme photodysphoria or light sensitivity. It is progressive and leads to blindness, usually by the second decade of life. Most patients develop mild-to-moderate slowly progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. There is evidence of multi-organ fibrosis in AS. DCM manifests in approximately 2/3 of patients, either as infants or as adolescents. Patients are at risk of sudden congestive heart failure at any age. Obesity with hyperphagia, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are early and consistent features. Liver dysfunction usually begins in childhood with steatosis (fatty liver). In some cases, cirrhosis, portal hypertension and liver failure can occur. Chronic respiratory illness (bronchitis/pneumonia), pulmonary hypertension, recurrent otitis media, and hypertriglyceridemia are frequent. Slowly progressive nephropathy can lead to end stage renal failure. Patients have distinctive facial characteristics ( thin hair, premature frontal balding, deep-set eyes with a rounded face and thick ears,). Most children have characteristic wide, thick, flat feet, and short stubby fingers and toes with no polydactyly or syndactyly. Hypogonadism in males/hyperandrogenism in females is also reported. Most patients have normal intelligence, although some reports have indicated delayed global development and intellectual disability. As some phenotypes develop slowly over time, non-classical presentations have also been reported.","Management should include vigilant monitoring and treatment of the emerging clinical manifestations. Red-orange tinted prescription lenses can reduce photophobia. As blindness occurs in all cases, early educational planning to teach patients Braille, computing skills and adaptive living skills is essential. Bilateral digital hearing aids and cochlear implants can increase hearing capabilities. Heart failure is mainly treated with angiotensinogen-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and digoxin. Heart transplantation could be also considered. Diabetes can be managed with a low-fat, low sugar diet, exercise, metformin, glitazones, incretin analogues, and SGLT2 inhibitors (beneficial in 2/3 of cases). Beta-blockers, sclerotherapy of the esophageal veins, and banding usually treat portal hypertension. In unsuccessful cases a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may be needed. In those with renal disease, ACE inhibitors can be considered. In several cases, renal transplantation has been successful. New medications are in clinical trials, and include PBI-4050 (phase 2 completed), a compound with anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties, and setmelanotide for the treatment of hyperphagia in rare forms of genetic obesity including AS.",,,,,,

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too.

Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Most patients are from consanguineous families. Prevalence may therefore vary significantly between countries.WRS may be underdiagnosed because of early death before diagnosis.,"Diabetes occurs early, generally before six months of age, is permanent and insulin-dependent from the onset. Skeletal dysplasia generally manifests within the 1st or 2nd year of life, and is associated with short stature (dwarfism with short trunk). Deficient mineralization or dysplastic changes, affecting the long bones, pelvis and vertebrae, but usually not the skull, may be seen on radiography as early as diabetes onset. Hepatic dysfunction is a 3rd characteristic feature and the most life-threatening complication, and manifests by elevated hepatic enzymes, liver enlargement and recurrent acute liver failure. Other manifestations vary between patients in type and severity and include renal dysfunction, exocrine pancreas insufficiency, intellectual deficit, hypothyroidism, neutropenia and recurrent infections. Clinical course is variable, including within the same sibship.","Close therapeutic monitoring of diabetes should be considered and treatment with an insulin pump is recommended, especially in the first months of life, due to the risk of acute episodes of hypoglycemia. At any age, hypoglycemia should be prevented because the disease can decompensate, even if this requires maintaining the level of glucose above the objectives generally recommended in diabetic children. General anesthesia increases the risk of acute aggravation, because of particular sensitivity of patients to anesthetics, and should be avoided wherever possible. Any drug or vaccine not strictly necessary should be limited, due to the risk of triggering secondary liver and/or kidney failure.",,,,,,

How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes.

Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies.

It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death.

How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.

As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.

Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods.

Mild global learning difficulties and acanthosis nigricans have also been reported.",<1/1000000,,,,"Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism, Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain . The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following: An average-size trunk, Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs, Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers, Limited mobility at the elbows, A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose, Progressive development of bowed legs, Progressive development of swayed lower back, An adult height around 4 feet, Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita . Signs may include: A very short trunk, A short neck, Shortened arms and legs, Average-size hands and feet, Broad, rounded chest, Slightly flattened cheekbones, Opening in the roof of the mouth, Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward, A foot that's twisted or out of shape, Instability of the neck bones, Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine, Progressive development of swayed lower back, Vision and hearing problems, Arthritis and problems with joint movement, Adult height ranging from 3 feet to just over 4 feet, Proportionate dwarfism, Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include: Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts, Growth rate slower than expected for age, Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years","Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders, but the causes of some disorders are unknown. Most occurrences of dwarfism result from a random genetic mutation in either the father's sperm or the mother's egg rather than from either parent's complete genetic makeup. Achondroplasia, About 80 percent of people with achondroplasia are born to parents of average height. A person with achondroplasia and with two average-size parents received one mutated copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene. A person with the disorder may pass along either a mutated or normal copy to his or her own children. Turner syndrome, Turner syndrome, a condition that affects only girls and women, results when a sex chromosome is missing or partially missing. A female inherits an X chromosome from each parent. A girl with Turner syndrome has only one fully functioning copy of the female sex chromosome rather than two. Growth hormone deficiency, The cause of growth hormone deficiency can sometimes be traced to a genetic mutation or injury, but for most people with the disorder, no cause can be identified. Other causes, Other causes of dwarfism include other genetic disorders, deficiencies in other hormones or poor nutrition. Sometimes the cause is unknown.","Complications of dwarfism-related disorders can vary greatly, but some complications are common to a number of conditions. Disproportionate dwarfism, The characteristic features of the skull, spine and limbs shared by most forms of disproportionate dwarfism result in some common problems: Delays in motor skills development, such as sitting up, crawling and walking, Frequent ear infections and risk of hearing loss, Bowing of the legs, Difficulty breathing during sleep, Pressure on the spinal cord at the base of the skull, Excess fluid around the brain, Crowded teeth, Progressive severe hunching or swaying of the back with back pain or problems breathing, Narrowing of the channel in the lower spine, resulting in pressure on the spinal cord and subsequent pain or numbness in the legs, Arthritis, Weight gain that can further complicate problems with joints and the spine and place pressure on nerves, Proportionate dwarfism, With proportionate dwarfism, problems in growth and development often result in complications with poorly developed organs. For example, heart problems that often occur with Turner syndrome can have a significant effect on health. An absence of sexual maturation associated with growth hormone deficiency or Turner syndrome affects both physical development and social functioning. Pregnancy, Women with disproportionate dwarfism may develop respiratory problems during pregnancy. A C-section is almost always necessary because the size and shape of the pelvis doesn't allow for successful vaginal delivery. Public perceptions, Most people with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by a condition. However, some people may refer to themselves as dwarfs, little people or people of short stature. The word ""midget"" is generally considered an offensive term. People of average height may have misconceptions about people with dwarfism. And the portrayal of people with dwarfism in modern movies often includes stereotypes. Misconceptions can impact a person's self-esteem and limit opportunities for success in school or employment. Children with dwarfism are particularly vulnerable to teasing and ridicule from classmates. Because dwarfism is relatively uncommon, children may feel isolated from their peers.",,,"When to see a doctor, Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child's doctor if you have any concerns about your child's growth or overall development."

Muscular dystrophy and cardiac arrhythmia are reported in CGL related to CAVIN1.","Diet should be carefully managed, avoiding overfeeding in patients with CGL who are typically hyperphagic due to leptin deficiency. A low glycemic-index and low fat diet, supplemented with medium chain triglycerides in infants/children, is usually needed to manage insulin resistance, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. Exercise should be encouraged in the absence of cardiac complications. Insulin sensitizers (mainly metformin) and lipid-lowering drugs (statins, or fibrates in case of major hypertriglyceridemia) are helpful. Diabetes may require other non-specific treatments, along with insulin.

Regular metabolic, hepatic and cardiac monitoring is recommended. Ethinylestradiol should be avoided in women with CGL.",,,,,,
33575,5015,diabetes mellitus (disease),,,A metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels due to diminished production of insulin or insulin resistance/desensitization.,A heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.,,,,,,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

How the kidneys work, Your kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Severe damage to these blood vessels can lead to diabetic nephropathy, decreased kidney function and kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy causes, Diabetic nephropathy is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can cause damage to blood vessel clusters in your kidneys that filter waste from your blood. This can lead to kidney damage and cause high blood pressure. High blood pressure can cause further kidney damage by increasing the pressure in the delicate filtering system of the kidneys.","Your risk of diabetic nephropathy is greater if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

With effective treatment of diabetes, you may prevent or delay diabetic kidney disease. Manage high blood pressure or other medical conditions. If you have high blood pressure or other conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage. Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers such as aspirin and ibuprofen, follow the instructions on the package. For people with diabetic kidney disease, taking these types of pain relievers can lead to kidney damage. Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about weight-loss strategies, such as increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories. Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop.","When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease.

38397,15650,epilepsy syndrome,,,,,,,,,,"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous to yourself or others. Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have epilepsy, you're 15 to 19 times more likely to drown while swimming or bathing than the rest of the population because of the possibility of having a seizure while in the water., Car accidents. A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Many states have driver's license restrictions related to a driver's ability to control seizures and impose a minimum amount of time that a driver be seizure-free, ranging from months to years, before being allowed to drive., , Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor as you plan your pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies. You'll need to be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, and medications may need to be adjusted. It's very important that you work with your doctor to plan your pregnancy., , Emotional health issues. People with epilepsy are more likely to have psychological problems, especially depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects. Other life-threatening complications of epilepsy are uncommon, but may happen, such as: Status epilepticus. This condition occurs if you're in a state of continuous seizure activity lasting more than five minutes or if you have frequent recurrent seizures without regaining full consciousness in between them. People with status epilepticus have an increased risk of permanent brain damage and death., , Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy . People with epilepsy also have a small risk of sudden unexpected death. The cause is unknown, but some research shows it may occur due to heart or respiratory conditions. People with frequent tonic-clonic seizures or people whose seizures aren't controlled by medications may be at higher risk of SUDEP. Overall, about 1 percent of people with epilepsy die of SUDEP.",,"When to see a doctor, Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're experiencing heat exhaustion. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice."

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes.

Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

97070,5442,type 1 diabetes nephropathy,,,Diabetic nephropathy is a progressive kidney disease caused by angiopathy of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli. In type 1 diabetes hyperglycaemia starts in the first decades of life and is usually the only recognized cause of nephropathy.,,,,,,,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes.

Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well.

If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."
98053,15967,monogenic diabetes,,,Rare genetic diabetes mellitus.,,,,,,,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity.

If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."
99386,23045,ectodermal dysplasia arthrogryposis diabetes mellitus,,,,,,,,,,"Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity.

Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Increased thirst, Frequent urination, Extreme hunger, Unexplained weight loss, Presence of ketones in the urine, Fatigue, Irritability, Blurred vision, Slow-healing sores, Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections, Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy.

About 50% of NDM cases are permanent (PNDM) and 50% transient (TNDM, see this term). The condition has been reported in all ethnic groups and affects male and female infants equally.","The median age of onset of PNDM is nine weeks. Initial clinical manifestations include hyperglycemia, glycosuria, intrauterine growth retardation, osmotic polyuria, severe dehydration, and failure to gain weight. The subsequent course of the disease depends on the genetic defect underlying DM. Most patients display some degree of developmental coordination disorder (including visual-spatial dyspraxia). Manifestations depend on the type of gene mutation involved. In KCNJ11 and ABCC8-related cases, patients usually present before three months of age with symptomatic hyperglycemia, and often ketoacidosis. Approximately 25% of patients with mutations in the KCNJ11 gene have associated neurological findings, including developmental delay and epilepsy (DEND syndrome, see this term) or a milder form of DEND without seizures and with less severe developmental delay (intermediate DEND, see this term). In INS-related cases, patients present with marked hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis usually at nine weeks, but some at a much later age. GCK-related PNDM patients have permanent insulin-dependent diabetes from the first day of life. Homozygous PDX1 mutations or mutations in other genes such as GATA6, PTF1A or HNF1B are related to rare cases of pancreatic hypoplasia with severe insulin deficiency and possibly exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Two groups can be distinguished based on pancreatic involvement: patients with abnormal pancreas development and children with a normal pancreas. Long-term complications include developmental delay, microalbuminuria, and retinopathy.","Immediate treatment involves rehydration and administration of intravenous insulin. Insulin can rapidly be switched to subcutaneously administered preparations. The aim is to control hyperglycemia and to enable catch-up growth. In those with KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations, a complete neurological assessment is recommended. Patients with activating mutations in these two genes can be treated long-term with oral sulfonylureas (currently in research protocols as no market authorization has yet been granted in this indication), and others with long-term insulin therapy.","Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated.

When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight.

If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein, or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Risk factors for gestational diabetes, Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Age. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Family or personal history. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Weight. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. Race or ethnicity. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.","Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Cardiovascular disease. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries . If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke., Nerve damage . Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction., Kidney damage . The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Eye damage . Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Skin conditions. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Alzheimer's disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Complications of gestational diabetes, Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. Complications in your baby can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Excess growth. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large . Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Low blood sugar. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Type 2 diabetes later in life. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Death. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. Complications in the mother also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Preeclampsia. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Complications of prediabetes, Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.","Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Get more physical activity. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week., Lose excess pounds. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes.","When to see a doctor, If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. If you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize."

Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40.","To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. How insulin works, Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach . The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. The role of glucose, Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. Your liver stores and makes glucose. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. Causes of type 1 diabetes, The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. Causes of gestational diabetes, During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.","Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes, Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells . Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Race or ethnicity. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Age. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds, you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. Polycystic ovary syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. High blood pressure.

Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn't known. Focal seizures, Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. You may seem awake, but you stare into space and do not respond normally to your environment or you perform repetitive movements. These may include hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. You may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred. Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don't lose consciousness. You may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are difficult to describe. These seizures may also result in difficulty speaking, involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for five to 10 seconds but may happen up to hundreds of times per day. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse, fall down or drop your head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. They may last for several minutes.","Nerve cells in the brain create, send and receive electrical impulses, which allow the brain's nerve cells to communicate. Anything that disrupts these communication pathways can lead to a seizure. Some types of seizure disorders may be caused by genetic mutations. The most common cause of seizures is epilepsy. But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy. Sometimes seizures may be caused or triggered by: High fever, which can be associated with an infection such as meningitis, Lack of sleep, Flashing lights, moving patterns or other visual stimulants, Low blood sodium, which can happen with diuretic therapy, Medications, such as certain pain relievers, antidepressants or smoking cessation therapies, that lower the seizure threshold, Head trauma that causes an area of bleeding in the brain, Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the brain, Autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, Stroke, Brain tumor, Use of illegal or recreational drugs, such as amphetamines or cocaine, Alcohol misuse, during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication, COVID-19 virus infection","Having a seizure can sometimes lead to circumstances that are dangerous for you or others. You might be at risk of: Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you're at risk of accidental drowning. Car accidents. A seizure that causes loss of either awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, work with your doctor so that he or she can adjust your medications and monitor your pregnancy, as needed. Emotional health issues. People with seizures are more likely to have psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety. Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects.",,,"When to see a doctor, Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're experiencing heat exhaustion. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice."
31562,32642,"arthrogryposis, cleft palate, craniosynostosis, and impaired intellectual development",,,,,,<1/1000000,,,,"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they'll become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected, An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull, Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows, Types of craniosynostosis, There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal . Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely, the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head, A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance.","Often the cause of craniosynostosis is not known, but sometimes it's related to genetic disorders. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, and its cause is unknown, although it's thought to be a combination of genes and environmental factors. Syndromic craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes, such as Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which can affect your baby's skull development. These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems.","If untreated, craniosynostosis may cause, for example: Permanent head and facial deformity, Poor self-esteem and social isolation, The risk of increased pressure inside the skull from simple craniosynostosis is small, as long as the suture and head shape are fixed surgically. But babies with an underlying syndrome may develop increased intracranial pressure if their skulls don't expand enough to make room for their growing brains. If untreated, increased intracranial pressure can cause: Developmental delays, Cognitive impairment, No energy or interest, Blindness, Eye movement disorders, Seizures, Death, in rare instances",,,"When to see a doctor, Your doctor will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape."

As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.

Death often is caused by the spread of the infection to the central nervous system, which can cause irreversible damage.",,"When to see a doctor, Whipple disease is potentially life-threatening yet usually treatable. Contact your doctor if you experience unusual signs or symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss or joint pain. Your doctor can perform tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. Even after the infection is diagnosed and you're receiving treatment, let your doctor know if your symptoms don't improve. Sometimes antibiotic therapy isn't effective because the bacteria are resistant to the particular drug you're taking. The disease can recur, so it's important to watch for symptoms that reappear."

Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables have many antioxidants, which help maintain the health of your eyes. Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But, a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts. Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits and are a safe way to increase the amount of minerals and vitamins in your diet., Wear sunglasses. Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you're outdoors. Reduce alcohol use. Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of cataracts.",,"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment for an eye exam if you notice any changes in your vision. If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or sudden headache, see your doctor right away."

How you hear, Your ear consists of three major areas: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. Sound waves pass through the outer ear and cause vibrations at the eardrum. The eardrum and three small bones of the middle ear amplify the vibrations as they travel to the inner ear. There, the vibrations pass through fluid in a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear . Attached to nerve cells in the cochlea are thousands of tiny hairs that help translate sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to your brain. Your brain turns these signals into sound. How hearing loss can occur, Causes of hearing loss include: Damage to the inner ear. Aging and exposure to loud noise may cause wear and tear on the hairs or nerve cells in the cochlea that send sound signals to the brain. When these hairs or nerve cells are damaged or missing, electrical signals aren't transmitted as efficiently, and hearing loss occurs. Higher pitched tones may become muffled to you. It may become difficult for you to pick out words against background noise., Gradual buildup of earwax. Earwax can block the ear canal and prevent conduction of sound waves.

Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later. Other types of muscular dystrophy, Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include: Myotonic. This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks. Facioscapulohumeral . Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders.

As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages.

Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Cognitive or emotional symptoms, such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where abnormal brain activity begins. Seizures may also be classified as unknown onset, if how the seizure began isn't known. Focal seizures, Focal seizures result from abnormal electrical activity in one area of your brain. Focal seizures can occur with or without loss of consciousness: Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. You may seem awake, but you stare into space and do not respond normally to your environment or you perform repetitive movements. These may include hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. You may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred. Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. These seizures may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound, but you don't lose consciousness. You may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are difficult to describe. These seizures may also result in difficulty speaking, involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include: Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or by subtle body movements, such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for five to 10 seconds but may happen up to hundreds of times per day. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse, fall down or drop your head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue. They may last for several minutes.","Nerve cells in the brain create, send and receive electrical impulses, which allow the brain's nerve cells to communicate. Anything that disrupts these communication pathways can lead to a seizure. Some types of seizure disorders may be caused by genetic mutations. The most common cause of seizures is epilepsy. But not every person who has a seizure has epilepsy. Sometimes seizures may be caused or triggered by: High fever, which can be associated with an infection such as meningitis, Lack of sleep, Flashing lights, moving patterns or other visual stimulants, Low blood sodium, which can happen with diuretic therapy, Medications, such as certain pain relievers, antidepressants or smoking cessation therapies, that lower the seizure threshold, Head trauma that causes an area of bleeding in the brain, Abnormalities of the blood vessels in the brain, Autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis, Stroke, Brain tumor, Use of illegal or recreational drugs, such as amphetamines or cocaine, Alcohol misuse, during times of withdrawal or extreme intoxication, COVID-19 virus infection","Having a seizure can sometimes lead to circumstances that are dangerous for you or others. You might be at risk of: Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have a seizure while swimming or bathing, you're at risk of accidental drowning. Car accidents. A seizure that causes loss of either awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and plan to become pregnant, work with your doctor so that he or she can adjust your medications and monitor your pregnancy, as needed. Emotional health issues. People with seizures are more likely to have psychological problems, such as depression and anxiety. Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects.",,,"When to see a doctor, Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're experiencing heat exhaustion. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice."

From infancy, almost all have severe global developmental delay with inability to walk and speech, and is followed by intellectual disability (ID). Dysmorphic craniofacial features include sparse hair, high forehead, high frontal hairline, sparse eyebrows, epicanthus, hypertelorism, broad and overhanging nasal tip, short philtrum, exaggerated cupid's bow, retrognathia/micrognathia and nevus flammeus simplex of the forehead. Microcephaly, short stature and feeding difficulties are also reported in some patients, and mandibular prognathia has been reported in various adult individuals from the same family. Other common features that have been described and include 2-3 toe syndactyly, congenital heart diseases (septal defects), urogenital and ocular anomalies (cataract, microcornea, microphthalmia), hypotonia and seizures. Cleft palate, hearing loss, hypospadias, kyphosis / scoliosis, camptodactyly, adducted thumb, tapered fingers with ulnar deviation, overlapping fingers / toes and hyperconvex nails have been described more rarely. Brain imaging abnormalities such as thin corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly and cerebral atrophy are common. Polymicrogyria has recently been reported as a distinctive neuro-radiological finding.","Management requires a lifelong multidisciplinary approach and includes physical, occupational and speech therapy, in particular non-verbal methods of communication. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Antiepileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Particular attention should be paid to monitoring feeding and growth, particularly as feeding problems tend to occur early on.","The primary sign of microcephaly is: A head size significantly smaller than that of other children of the same age and sex, Head size is measured as the distance around the top of the child's head . Using standardized growth charts, the measurement is compared with other children's measurements in percentiles. Some children just have small heads, whose measurement falls as low as the first percentile. In children with microcephaly, head size measures significantly below average, possibly even below the first percentile for your baby's age and sex. A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a backward-sloping forehead.","Microcephaly usually is the result of abnormal brain development, which can occur in the womb or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain . Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles, chickenpox and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these put your baby at risk of brain abnormalities. Severe malnutrition. Not getting adequate nutrition during pregnancy can affect your baby's development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, in the mother. PKU is a birth defect that hampers the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine.","Some children with microcephaly are of normal intelligence and development, even though their heads will always be small for their age and sex. But depending on the cause and severity of the microcephaly, complications may include: Developmental delays, such as in speech and movement, Difficulties with coordination and balance, Dwarfism or short stature, Facial distortions, Hyperactivity, Intellectual disabilities, Seizures","Learning your child has microcephaly can raise questions about future pregnancies. Work with your doctor to determine the cause of the microcephaly. If the cause is genetic, you and may want to talk to a genetics counselor about the risk of microcephaly in future pregnancies.",,"When to see a doctor, Chances are your doctor will detect microcephaly at the baby's birth or at a regular well-baby checkup. However, if you think your baby's head is smaller than normal or isn't growing as it should, talk to your doctor."

Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma.

29883,10380,"cataract, ataxia, short stature, and intellectual disability",,,,,,,,,,"Ataxia can develop over time or come on suddenly. A sign of a number of neurological disorders, ataxia can cause: Poor coordination, Unsteady walk and a tendency to stumble, Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt, Change in speech, Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, Difficulty swallowing","Damage, degeneration or loss of nerve cells in the part of your brain that controls muscle coordination, results in ataxia. Your cerebellum comprises two portions of folded tissue situated at the base of your brain near your brainstem. This area of the brain helps with balance as well as eye movements, swallowing and speech. Diseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect your cerebellum to your muscles also can cause ataxia. Ataxia causes include: Head trauma. Damage to your brain or spinal cord from a blow to your head, such as might occur in a car accident, can cause acute cerebellar ataxia, which comes on suddenly. Stroke. Either a blockage or bleeding in the brain can cause ataxia. When the blood supply to a part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells die. Cerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements. Autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. Infections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the ataxia resolves over time. Paraneoplastic syndromes. These are rare, degenerative disorders triggered by your immune system's response to a cancerous tumor, most commonly from lung, ovarian, breast or lymphatic cancer. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed. Abnormalities in the brain. An infected area in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, cancerous or noncancerous, can damage the cerebellum., Toxic reaction. Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy. Vitamin B-6 toxicity also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because the effects are often reversible. Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication. Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia., Vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or thiamine deficiency. Not getting enough of these nutrients, because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol misuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia. Thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia. COVID-19 infection. This infection may cause ataxia, most commonly in very severe cases. For some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found. Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder. Hereditary ataxias, Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins. The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. You can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent or a recessive gene from each parent . In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder, so there might be no obvious family history. Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms. Autosomal dominant ataxias, These include: Spinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation. Episodic ataxia . There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. EA1 and EA2 are the most common. EA1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching. EA2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. You might have dizziness, fatigue and muscle weakness during your episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms might respond to medication. Autosomal recessive ataxias, These include: Friedreich's ataxia. This common hereditary ataxia involves damage to your cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry signals from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles. In most cases, signs and symptoms appear well before age 25. The rate of disease progression varies. The first indication generally is difficulty walking . The condition typically progresses to the arms and trunk. Muscles weaken and waste away over time, causing deformities, particularly in your feet, lower legs and hands. Other signs and symptoms that might develop as the disease progresses include slow, slurred speech ; fatigue; rapid, involuntary eye movements ; spinal curvature ; hearing loss; and heart disease, including heart enlargement and heart failure. Early treatment of heart problems can improve quality of life and survival., , Ataxia-telangiectasia. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. The disease also causes immune system breakdown, which increases susceptibility to other diseases, including infections and tumors. It affects various organs. Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red ""spider"" veins that might appear in the corners of your child's eyes or on the ears and cheeks. Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are typically the first indications of the disease. Recurrent sinus and respiratory infections are common. Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung disease., Congenital cerebellar ataxia. This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth. Wilson's disease. People with this condition accumulate copper in their brains, livers and other organs, which can cause neurological problems, including ataxia. Early identification of this disorder can lead to treatment that will slow progression.",,,,"When to see a doctor, If you aren't aware of having a condition that causes ataxia, such as multiple sclerosis, see your doctor as soon as possible if you: Lose balance, Lose muscle coordination in a hand, arm or leg, Have difficulty walking, Slur your speech, Have difficulty swallowing"

This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables.

Using standardized growth charts, the measurement is compared with other children's measurements in percentiles. Some children just have small heads, whose measurement falls as low as the first percentile. In children with microcephaly, head size measures significantly below average, possibly even below the first percentile for your baby's age and sex. A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a backward-sloping forehead.","Microcephaly usually is the result of abnormal brain development, which can occur in the womb or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain . Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles, chickenpox and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these put your baby at risk of brain abnormalities. Severe malnutrition. Not getting adequate nutrition during pregnancy can affect your baby's development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, in the mother.

Signs and symptoms of different types of dermatitis include: Atopic dermatitis . Usually beginning in infancy, this red, itchy rash usually occurs where the skin flexes — inside the elbows, behind the knees and in front of the neck. The rash may leak fluid when scratched and crust over. People with atopic dermatitis may experience improvement and then seasonal flare-ups. Contact dermatitis. This red, itchy stinging rash occurs where your skin has come into contact with substances that irritate the skin or cause an allergic reaction. You may develop blisters. Seborrheic dermatitis. This condition causes scaly patches, red skin and stubborn dandruff. It usually affects oily areas of the body, such as the face, upper chest and back. Seborrheic dermatitis can be a long-term condition with periods of improvement and then seasonal flare-ups. In infants, this condition is called cradle cap. Follicular eczema. With this type, the affected skin thickens and develops bumps in hair follicles. This condition is common in African Americans and in people with dark-brown skin.","Causes of the most common types of dermatitis include: Atopic dermatitis . This type is likely related to dry skin, a gene variation, an immune system dysfunction, a skin infection, exposure to food, airborne, or contact allergens, or a combination of these. Contact dermatitis. This type results from contact with something that irritates your skin or causes an allergic reaction. Irritants or allergens include poison ivy, perfumes, jewelry containing nickel, cleaning products, and the preservatives in many creams and lotions. Seborrheic dermatitis. This type is caused by a yeast that is in the oil secretion on the skin.","Common risk factors for dermatitis include: Age. Dermatitis can occur at any age, but atopic dermatitis usually begins in infancy. Allergies and asthma. People who have a personal or family history of eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma are more likely to develop atopic dermatitis. Occupation. Jobs that put you in contact with certain metals, solvents or cleaning supplies increase your risk of contact dermatitis. Being a health care worker is linked to hand eczema. Health conditions. Health conditions that put you at increased risk of seborrheic dermatitis include congestive heart failure, Parkinson's disease and HIV/AIDS.","Scratching the itchy rash associated with dermatitis can cause open sores, which may become infected. These skin infections can spread and may very rarely become life-threatening.","Wear protective clothing if you are doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals. Avoid dry skin by adopting these habits when bathing: Take shorter baths and showers. Limit your baths and showers to 5 to 10 minutes. Use warm, rather than hot, water. Bath oil also may be helpful. Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser. Choose unscented nonsoap cleansers. Some soaps can dry your skin. Dry yourself gently. After bathing, gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel. Moisturize your skin. While your skin is still damp, seal in moisture with an oil, cream or lotion. Try different products to find one that works for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented. Two small studies showed that applying a protective moisturizer to the skin of infants at high risk of atopic dermatitis reduced the incidence of the condition by up to 50 percent.","When to see a doctor, See your doctor if: You're so uncomfortable that you are losing sleep or are distracted from your daily routines, Your skin becomes painful, You suspect your skin is infected, You've tried self-care steps but your signs and symptoms persist"

How you hear, Your ear consists of three major areas: outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. Sound waves pass through the outer ear and cause vibrations at the eardrum. The eardrum and three small bones of the middle ear amplify the vibrations as they travel to the inner ear. There, the vibrations pass through fluid in a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear . Attached to nerve cells in the cochlea are thousands of tiny hairs that help translate sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to your brain. Your brain turns these signals into sound. How hearing loss can occur, Causes of hearing loss include: Damage to the inner ear. Aging and exposure to loud noise may cause wear and tear on the hairs or nerve cells in the cochlea that send sound signals to the brain. When these hairs or nerve cells are damaged or missing, electrical signals aren't transmitted as efficiently, and hearing loss occurs. Higher pitched tones may become muffled to you. It may become difficult for you to pick out words against background noise., Gradual buildup of earwax. Earwax can block the ear canal and prevent conduction of sound waves. Earwax removal can help restore your hearing. Ear infection and abnormal bone growths or tumors. In the outer or middle ear, any of these can cause hearing loss. Ruptured eardrum . Loud blasts of noise, sudden changes in pressure, poking your eardrum with an object and infection can cause your eardrum to rupture and affect your hearing.","Factors that may damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in your inner ear include: Aging. Degeneration of inner ear structures occurs over time. Loud noise. Exposure to loud sounds can damage the cells of your inner ear. Damage can occur with long-term exposure to loud noises, or from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot. Heredity. Your genetic makeup may make you more susceptible to ear damage from sound or deterioration from aging. Occupational noises. Jobs where loud noise is a regular part of the working environment, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside your ear. Recreational noises. Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss. Other recreational activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music. Some medications. Drugs such as the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil and certain chemotherapy drugs, can damage the inner ear. Temporary effects on your hearing — ringing in the ear or hearing loss — can occur if you take very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics. Some illnesses. Diseases or illnesses that result in high fever, such as meningitis, may damage the cochlea. Comparing loudness of common sounds, The chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels. The Environmental Protection Agency's safe noise level is 70 decibels. The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause permanent hearing damage.

Older adults with hearing loss may report feelings of depression. Because hearing loss can make conversation difficult, some people experience feelings of isolation. Hearing loss is also associated with cognitive impairment and decline. The mechanism of interaction between hearing loss, cognitive impairment, depression and isolation is being actively studied. Initial research suggests that treating hearing loss can have a positive effect on cognitive performance, especially memory.","The following steps can help you prevent noise-induced hearing loss and avoid worsening of age-related hearing loss: Protect your ears. Limiting the duration and intensity of your exposure to noise is the best protection. In the workplace, plastic earplugs or glycerin-filled earmuffs can help protect your ears from damaging noise. Have your hearing tested. Consider regular hearing tests if you work in a noisy environment. If you've lost some hearing, you can take steps to prevent further loss. Avoid recreational risks. Activities such as riding a snowmobile, hunting, using power tools or listening to rock concerts can damage your hearing over time. Wearing hearing protectors or taking breaks from the noise can protect your ears. Turning down the music volume is helpful too.","When to see a doctor, If you have a sudden loss of hearing, particularly in one ear, seek immediate medical attention. Talk to your doctor if difficulty hearing is interfering with your daily life. Age-related hearing loss occurs gradually, so you may not notice it at first."

But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include: Back pain, caused by a fractured or collapsed vertebra, Loss of height over time, A stooped posture, A bone that breaks much more easily than expected","Your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down. When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created. How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is somewhat inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have ""in the bank"" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age.","A number of factors can increase the likelihood that you'll develop osteoporosis — including your age, race, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions and treatments. Unchangeable risks, Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including: Your sex. Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men. Age. The older you get, the greater your risk of osteoporosis. Race. You're at greatest risk of osteoporosis if you're white or of Asian descent. Family history. Having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts you at greater risk, especially if your mother or father fractured a hip. Body frame size. Men and women who have small body frames tend to have a higher risk because they might have less bone mass to draw from as they age. Hormone levels, Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies. Examples include: Sex hormones. Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone. The reduction of estrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis. Men have a gradual reduction in testosterone levels as they age. Treatments for prostate cancer that reduce testosterone levels in men and treatments for breast cancer that reduce estrogen levels in women are likely to accelerate bone loss., Thyroid problems. Too much thyroid hormone can cause bone loss. This can occur if your thyroid is overactive or if you take too much thyroid hormone medication to treat an underactive thyroid. Other glands. Osteoporosis has also been associated with overactive parathyroid and adrenal glands. Dietary factors, Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have: Low calcium intake. A lifelong lack of calcium plays a role in the development of osteoporosis. Low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures. Eating disorders. Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women. Gastrointestinal surgery. Surgery to reduce the size of your stomach or to remove part of the intestine limits the amount of surface area available to absorb nutrients, including calcium. These surgeries include those to help you lose weight and for other gastrointestinal disorders. Steroids and other medications, Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process. Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent: Seizures, Gastric reflux, Cancer, Transplant rejection, Medical conditions, The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including: Celiac disease, Inflammatory bowel disease, Kidney or liver disease, Cancer, Lupus, Multiple myeloma, Rheumatoid arthritis, Lifestyle choices, Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Examples include: Sedentary lifestyle. People who spend a lot of time sitting have a higher risk of osteoporosis than do those who are more active. Any weight-bearing exercise and activities that promote balance and good posture are beneficial for your bones, but walking, running, jumping, dancing and weightlifting seem particularly helpful. Excessive alcohol consumption. Regular consumption of more than two alcoholic drinks a day increases your risk of osteoporosis. Tobacco use. The exact role tobacco plays in osteoporosis isn't clear, but it has been shown that tobacco use contributes to weak bones.","Bone fractures, particularly in the spine or hip, are the most serious complications of osteoporosis. Hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury. In some cases, spinal fractures can occur even if you haven't fallen. The bones that make up your spine can weaken to the point of crumpling, which can result in back pain, lost height and a hunched forward posture.","Good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life. Protein, Protein is one of the building blocks of bone. However, there's conflicting evidence about the impact of protein intake on bone density. Most people get plenty of protein in their diets, but some do not. Vegetarians and vegans can get enough protein in the diet if they intentionally seek suitable sources, such as soy, nuts, legumes, seeds for vegans and vegetarians, and dairy and eggs for vegetarians. Older adults might eat less protein for various reasons. If you think you're not getting enough protein, ask your doctor if supplementation is an option. Body weight, Being underweight increases the chance of bone loss and fractures. Excess weight is now known to increase the risk of fractures in your arm and wrist. As such, maintaining an appropriate body weight is good for bones just as it is for health in general. Calcium, Men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70. Good sources of calcium include: Low-fat dairy products, Dark green leafy vegetables, Canned salmon or sardines with bones, Soy products, such as tofu, Calcium-fortified cereals and orange juice, If you find it difficult to get enough calcium from your diet, consider taking calcium supplements. However, too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones. Although yet unclear, some experts suggest that too much calcium especially in supplements can increase the risk of heart disease. The Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommends that total calcium intake, from supplements and diet combined, should be no more than 2,000 milligrams daily for people older than 50. Vitamin D, Vitamin D improves your body's ability to absorb calcium and improves bone health in other ways. People can get some of their vitamin D from sunlight, but this might not be a good source if you live in a high latitude, if you're housebound, or if you regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun because of the risk of skin cancer. To get enough vitamin D to maintain bone health, it's recommended that adults ages 51 to 70 get 600 international units and 800 IU a day after age 70 through food or supplements. People without other sources of vitamin D and especially with limited sun exposure might need a supplement. Most multivitamin products contain between 600 and 800 IU of vitamin D. Up to 4,000 IU of vitamin D a day is safe for most people. Exercise, Exercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss. Exercise will benefit your bones no matter when you start, but you'll gain the most benefits if you start exercising regularly when you're young and continue to exercise throughout your life. Combine strength training exercises with weight-bearing and balance exercises. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine. Weight-bearing exercises — such as walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skipping rope, skiing and impact-producing sports — affect mainly the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine. Balance exercises such as tai chi can reduce your risk of falling especially as you get older. Swimming, cycling and exercising on machines such as elliptical trainers can provide a good cardiovascular workout, but they don't improve bone health.","When to see a doctor, You might want to talk to your doctor about osteoporosis if you went through early menopause or took corticosteroids for several months at a time, or if either of your parents had hip fractures."

Hypotonia, growth and developmental delay, seizures, and joint limitation are also reported.",<1/1000000,,,,"Heart disease symptoms depend on what type of heart disease you have. Symptoms of heart disease in your blood vessels, A buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries, or atherosclerosis can damage your blood vessels and heart. Plaque buildup causes narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other signs and symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. Signs and symptoms can include: Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort, Shortness of breath, Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed, Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back","Heart disease causes depend on your specific type of heart disease. There are many different types of heart disease. To understand the causes of heart disease, it helps to understand how the heart works. How the heart works, Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, located slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left sides. The right side of the heart includes the right atrium and ventricle. It collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries. The lungs give the blood a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product. Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, including the left atrium and ventricle. The left side of the heart pumps blood through the largest artery in the body to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients. Heart valves, Four heart valves keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To work properly, the valves must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are: Tricuspid, Mitral, Pulmonary, Aortic, Heartbeats, A beating heart squeezes and relaxes in a continuous cycle. During contraction, your ventricles squeeze tight, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body. During relaxation, the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers . Electrical system, Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating. Your heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive. Electrical signals begin high in the upper right chamber and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump. The system keeps your heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood flowing. Causes of coronary artery disease, A buildup of fatty plaques in your arteries is the most common cause of coronary artery disease. Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as a poor diet, lack of exercise, being overweight and smoking, can lead to atherosclerosis. Causes of heart arrhythmia, Common causes of arrhythmias or conditions that can lead to arrhythmias include: Coronary artery disease, Diabetes, Drug abuse, Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine, Heart defects you're born with, High blood pressure, Smoking, Some over-the-counter medications, prescription medications, dietary supplements and herbal remedies, Stress, Valvular heart disease, In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a deadly arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical signals may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop. Causes of congenital heart defects, Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects. Heart defects can also develop in adults. As you age, your heart's structure can change, causing a heart defect. Causes of cardiomyopathy, The cause of cardiomyopathy, a thickening or enlarging of the heart muscle, may depend on the type: Dilated cardiomyopathy. The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. The condition usually causes the left ventricle to widen. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by reduced blood flow to the heart resulting from damage after a heart attack, infections, toxins and certain drugs, including those used to treat cancer. It may also be inherited from a parent. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type usually is passed down through families . It can also develop over time because of high blood pressure or aging. Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason. Or it may be caused by diseases, such as connective tissue disorders or the buildup of abnormal proteins . Causes of heart infection, A heart infection, such as endocarditis, is caused when germs reach your heart muscle. The most common causes of heart infection include: Bacteria, Viruses, Parasites, Causes of valvular heart disease, Many things can cause diseases of your heart valves. You may be born with valvular disease, or the valves may be damaged by conditions such as: Rheumatic fever, Infections, Connective tissue disorders","Risk factors for developing heart disease include: Age. Growing older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle. Sex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause. Family history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age . Smoking. Nicotine tightens your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. Poor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease. High blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows. High blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Diabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Obesity. Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors. Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors as well. Stress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease. Poor dental health. It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often, and have regular dental checkups. If your teeth and gums aren't healthy, germs can enter your bloodstream and travel to your heart, causing endocarditis.","Complications of heart disease include: Heart failure. One of the most common complications of heart disease, heart failure occurs when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure can result from many forms of heart disease, including heart defects, cardiovascular disease, valvular heart disease, heart infections or cardiomyopathy. Heart attack. A blood clot blocking the blood flow through a blood vessel that feeds the heart causes a heart attack, possibly damaging or destroying a part of the heart muscle. Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack. Stroke. The risk factors that lead to cardiovascular disease can also lead to an ischemic stroke, which happens when the arteries to your brain are narrowed or blocked so that too little blood reaches your brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke. Aneurysm. A serious complication that can occur anywhere in your body, an aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of your artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may face life-threatening internal bleeding. Peripheral artery disease. When you develop peripheral artery disease, your extremities — usually your legs — don't receive enough blood flow. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking . Atherosclerosis also can lead to peripheral artery disease. Sudden cardiac arrest. Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden, unexpected loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness, often caused by an arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death.","Certain types of heart disease, such as heart defects, can't be prevented. However, the same lifestyle changes that can improve your heart disease can help you prevent it, including: Don't smoke. Control other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. Maintain a healthy weight. Reduce and manage stress. Practice good hygiene.","You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for cardiovascular symptoms and discuss concerns with your doctor. Cardiovascular disease can sometimes be found early with regular evaluations. Heart disease symptoms caused by abnormal heartbeats, Your heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia signs and symptoms can include: Fluttering in your chest, Racing heartbeat, Slow heartbeat, Chest pain or discomfort, Shortness of breath, Lightheadedness, Dizziness, Fainting or near fainting, Heart disease symptoms caused by heart defects, Serious heart defects that you're born with usually are noticed soon after birth. Heart defect signs and symptoms in children could include: Pale gray or blue skin color, Swelling in the legs, abdomen or areas around the eyes, In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain, Less serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include: Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity, Easily tiring during exercise or activity, Swelling in the hands, ankles or feet, Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle, In early stages of cardiomyopathy, you may have no symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include: Breathlessness with activity or at rest, Swelling of the legs, ankles and feet, Fatigue, Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering, Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting, Heart disease symptoms caused by heart infection, Endocarditis is an infection that affects the inner lining of your heart chambers and heart valves . Heart infection signs and symptoms can include: Fever, Shortness of breath, Weakness or fatigue, Swelling in your legs or abdomen, Changes in your heart rhythm, Dry or persistent cough, Skin rashes or unusual spots, Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems, The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves — that open and close to direct blood flow through your heart. Many things can damage your heart valves, leading to narrowing, leaking or improper closing . Depending on which valve isn't working properly, valvular heart disease signs and symptoms generally include: Fatigue, Shortness of breath, Irregular heartbeat, Swollen feet or ankles, Chest pain, Fainting, When to see a doctor, Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease signs and symptoms: Chest pain, Shortness of breath, Fainting, Always call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack. Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early, so talk to your doctor about your concerns regarding your heart health. If you're concerned about developing heart disease, talk to your doctor about steps you can take to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease. If you think you may have heart disease, based on new signs or symptoms you're having, make an appointment to see your doctor."

As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables have many antioxidants, which help maintain the health of your eyes. Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But, a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts. Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits and are a safe way to increase the amount of minerals and vitamins in your diet., Wear sunglasses. Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you're outdoors. Reduce alcohol use. Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of cataracts.",,"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment for an eye exam if you notice any changes in your vision. If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or sudden headache, see your doctor right away."

Some children just have small heads, whose measurement falls as low as the first percentile. In children with microcephaly, head size measures significantly below average, possibly even below the first percentile for your baby's age and sex. A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a backward-sloping forehead.","Microcephaly usually is the result of abnormal brain development, which can occur in the womb or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain . Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles, chickenpox and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these put your baby at risk of brain abnormalities. Severe malnutrition. Not getting adequate nutrition during pregnancy can affect your baby's development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, in the mother.

A sign of a number of neurological disorders, ataxia can cause: Poor coordination, Unsteady walk and a tendency to stumble, Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt, Change in speech, Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, Difficulty swallowing","Damage, degeneration or loss of nerve cells in the part of your brain that controls muscle coordination, results in ataxia. Your cerebellum comprises two portions of folded tissue situated at the base of your brain near your brainstem. This area of the brain helps with balance as well as eye movements, swallowing and speech. Diseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect your cerebellum to your muscles also can cause ataxia. Ataxia causes include: Head trauma. Damage to your brain or spinal cord from a blow to your head, such as might occur in a car accident, can cause acute cerebellar ataxia, which comes on suddenly. Stroke. Either a blockage or bleeding in the brain can cause ataxia. When the blood supply to a part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells die. Cerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements. Autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. Infections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the ataxia resolves over time. Paraneoplastic syndromes. These are rare, degenerative disorders triggered by your immune system's response to a cancerous tumor, most commonly from lung, ovarian, breast or lymphatic cancer. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed. Abnormalities in the brain. An infected area in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, cancerous or noncancerous, can damage the cerebellum., Toxic reaction. Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy. Vitamin B-6 toxicity also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because the effects are often reversible. Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication. Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia., Vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or thiamine deficiency. Not getting enough of these nutrients, because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol misuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia. Thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia. COVID-19 infection. This infection may cause ataxia, most commonly in very severe cases. For some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found. Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder. Hereditary ataxias, Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins. The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. You can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent or a recessive gene from each parent . In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder, so there might be no obvious family history. Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms. Autosomal dominant ataxias, These include: Spinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation. Episodic ataxia . There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. EA1 and EA2 are the most common. EA1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching. EA2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. You might have dizziness, fatigue and muscle weakness during your episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms might respond to medication. Autosomal recessive ataxias, These include: Friedreich's ataxia. This common hereditary ataxia involves damage to your cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry signals from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles. In most cases, signs and symptoms appear well before age 25. The rate of disease progression varies. The first indication generally is difficulty walking . The condition typically progresses to the arms and trunk. Muscles weaken and waste away over time, causing deformities, particularly in your feet, lower legs and hands. Other signs and symptoms that might develop as the disease progresses include slow, slurred speech ; fatigue; rapid, involuntary eye movements ; spinal curvature ; hearing loss; and heart disease, including heart enlargement and heart failure. Early treatment of heart problems can improve quality of life and survival., , Ataxia-telangiectasia. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. The disease also causes immune system breakdown, which increases susceptibility to other diseases, including infections and tumors. It affects various organs. Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red ""spider"" veins that might appear in the corners of your child's eyes or on the ears and cheeks. Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are typically the first indications of the disease. Recurrent sinus and respiratory infections are common. Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung disease., Congenital cerebellar ataxia. This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth. Wilson's disease. People with this condition accumulate copper in their brains, livers and other organs, which can cause neurological problems, including ataxia.

Using standardized growth charts, the measurement is compared with other children's measurements in percentiles. Some children just have small heads, whose measurement falls as low as the first percentile. In children with microcephaly, head size measures significantly below average, possibly even below the first percentile for your baby's age and sex. A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a backward-sloping forehead.","Microcephaly usually is the result of abnormal brain development, which can occur in the womb or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain . Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles, chickenpox and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these put your baby at risk of brain abnormalities. Severe malnutrition. Not getting adequate nutrition during pregnancy can affect your baby's development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, in the mother. PKU is a birth defect that hampers the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine.","Some children with microcephaly are of normal intelligence and development, even though their heads will always be small for their age and sex. But depending on the cause and severity of the microcephaly, complications may include: Developmental delays, such as in speech and movement, Difficulties with coordination and balance, Dwarfism or short stature, Facial distortions, Hyperactivity, Intellectual disabilities, Seizures","Learning your child has microcephaly can raise questions about future pregnancies. Work with your doctor to determine the cause of the microcephaly. If the cause is genetic, you and may want to talk to a genetics counselor about the risk of microcephaly in future pregnancies.",,"When to see a doctor, Chances are your doctor will detect microcephaly at the baby's birth or at a regular well-baby checkup. However, if you think your baby's head is smaller than normal or isn't growing as it should, talk to your doctor."

As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients.

But some people experience back pain and stiffness in addition to an abnormally curved spine.,"The individual bones that make up a healthy spine look like cylinders stacked in a column. Kyphosis occurs when the vertebrae in the upper back become more wedge shaped. Abnormal vertebrae can be caused by: Fractures. Broken or crushed vertebrae can result in curvature of the spine. Mild compression fractures often don't produce noticeable signs or symptoms. Osteoporosis. This bone-thinning disorder can cause spinal curvature, especially if weakened vertebrae result in compression fractures. Osteoporosis is most common in older women and people who have taken corticosteroids for long periods of time. Disk degeneration. Soft, circular disks act as cushions between spinal vertebrae. With age, these disks dry out and shrink, which often worsens kyphosis. Scheuermann's disease. Also called Scheuermann's kyphosis, this disease typically begins during the growth spurt that occurs before puberty. Boys are affected more often than girls. Birth defects. Spinal bones that don't develop properly before birth can cause kyphosis. Syndromes. Kyphosis in children can also be associated with certain syndromes, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Cancer and cancer treatments. Cancer in the spine can weaken vertebrae and make them more prone to compression fractures, as can chemotherapy and radiation cancer treatments.","In addition to causing back pain, kyphosis may cause: Breathing problems. Severe kyphosis can put pressure on the lungs. Limited physical functions. Kyphosis is associated with weakened back muscles and difficulty doing tasks such as walking and getting out of chairs. The spinal curvature can also make it difficult to gaze upward or drive and can cause pain when you lie down. Digestive problems. Severe kyphosis can compress the digestive tract, causing problems such as acid reflux and difficulty with swallowing. Body image problems. People with kyphosis, especially adolescents, may develop a poor body image from having a rounded back or from wearing a brace to correct the condition.

94759,15468,craniosynostosis-cataract syndrome,,,,Premature closure of one or more cranial sutures. It often results in plagiocephaly. Craniosynostoses that involve multiple sutures are sometimes associated with congenital syndromes such as acrocephalosyndactylia; and craniofacial dysostosis.,,,,,,"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they'll become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. These can include: A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected, An abnormal feeling or disappearing fontanel on your baby's skull, Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, Slow or no growth of the head as your baby grows, Types of craniosynostosis, There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Most cases of multiple suture craniosynostosis are linked to genetic syndromes and are called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include: Sagittal . Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. Sagittal craniosynostosis results in a head shape called scaphocephaly and is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely, the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of your baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side. Other reasons for a misshapen head, A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time on one side of his or her head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy to help reshape the head to a more normal appearance.","Often the cause of craniosynostosis is not known, but sometimes it's related to genetic disorders. Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, and its cause is unknown, although it's thought to be a combination of genes and environmental factors. Syndromic craniosynostosis is caused by certain genetic syndromes, such as Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which can affect your baby's skull development. These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems.","If untreated, craniosynostosis may cause, for example: Permanent head and facial deformity, Poor self-esteem and social isolation, The risk of increased pressure inside the skull from simple craniosynostosis is small, as long as the suture and head shape are fixed surgically. But babies with an underlying syndrome may develop increased intracranial pressure if their skulls don't expand enough to make room for their growing brains. If untreated, increased intracranial pressure can cause: Developmental delays, Cognitive impairment, No energy or interest, Blindness, Eye movement disorders, Seizures, Death, in rare instances",,,"When to see a doctor, Your doctor will routinely monitor your child's head growth at well-child visits. Talk to your pediatrician if you have concerns about your baby's head growth or shape."
94826,15567,cataract-glaucoma syndrome,,,Cataract-glaucoma syndrome is characterised by the association of total bilateral congenital cataract with the secondary occurrence of glaucoma appearing at ages varying between 10 and 40 years.,Cataract that is present at birth.,Cataract-glaucoma syndrome is characterised by the association of total bilateral congenital cataract with the secondary occurrence of glaucoma appearing at ages varying between 10 and 40 years.,<1/1000000,"This very rare syndrome has only been described in three families, one of which contained a few dozen affected individuals spanning eight generations.",,The cataract can be managed by classical surgery. Yearly monitoring of ocular tonus is advised; hypertonia is treated classically when it appears.,"The signs and symptoms of glaucoma vary depending on the type and stage of your condition. For example: Open-angle glaucoma, Patchy blind spots in your side or central vision, frequently in both eyes, Tunnel vision in the advanced stages, Acute angle-closure glaucoma, Severe headache, Eye pain, Nausea and vomiting, Blurred vision, Halos around lights, Eye redness, If left untreated, glaucoma will eventually cause blindness. Even with treatment, about 15 percent of people with glaucoma become blind in at least one eye within 20 years.","Glaucoma is the result of damage to the optic nerve. As this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your visual field. For reasons that doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye. Elevated eye pressure is due to a buildup of a fluid that flows throughout the inside of your eye. This internal fluid normally drains out through a tissue called the trabecular meshwork at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. When fluid is overproduced or the drainage system doesn't work properly, the fluid can't flow out at its normal rate and eye pressure increases. Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage. Types of glaucoma include: Open-angle glaucoma, Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of the disease. The drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris remains open, but the trabecular meshwork is partially blocked. This causes pressure in the eye to gradually increase. This pressure damages the optic nerve. It happens so slowly that you may lose vision before you're even aware of a problem. Angle-closure glaucoma, Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma, occurs when the iris bulges forward to narrow or block the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris. As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Angle-closure glaucoma may occur suddenly or gradually . Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency. Normal-tension glaucoma, In normal-tension glaucoma, your optic nerve becomes damaged even though your eye pressure is within the normal range. No one knows the exact reason for this. You may have a sensitive optic nerve, or you may have less blood being supplied to your optic nerve. This limited blood flow could be caused by atherosclerosis — the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries — or other conditions that impair circulation. Glaucoma in children, It's possible for infants and children to have glaucoma. It may be present from birth or develop in the first few years of life. The optic nerve damage may be caused by drainage blockages or an underlying medical condition. Pigmentary glaucoma, In pigmentary glaucoma, pigment granules from your iris build up in the drainage channels, slowing or blocking fluid exiting your eye. Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules, depositing them on the trabecular meshwork and causing intermittent pressure elevations.","Because chronic forms of glaucoma can destroy vision before any signs or symptoms are apparent, be aware of these risk factors: Having high internal eye pressure, Being over age 60, Being black, Asian or Hispanic, Having a family history of glaucoma, Having certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia, Having corneas that are thin in the center, Being extremely nearsighted or farsighted, Having had an eye injury or certain types of eye surgery, Taking corticosteroid medications, especially eyedrops, for a long time","These self-care steps can help you detect glaucoma in its early stages, which is important in preventing vision loss or slowing its progress. Get regular dilated eye examinations. Regular comprehensive eye exams can help detect glaucoma in its early stages, before significant damage occurs. As a general rule, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends having a comprehensive eye exam every five to 10 years if you're under 40 years old; every two to four years if you're 40 to 54 years old; every one to three years if you're 55 to 64 years old; and every one to two years if you're older than 65. If you're at risk of glaucoma, you'll need more frequent screening. Ask your doctor to recommend the right screening schedule for you. Know your family's eye health history. Glaucoma tends to run in families. If you're at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening. Exercise safely. Regular, moderate exercise may help prevent glaucoma by reducing eye pressure. Talk with your doctor about an appropriate exercise program. Take prescribed eyedrops regularly. Glaucoma eyedrops can significantly reduce the risk that high eye pressure will progress to glaucoma. To be effective, eyedrops prescribed by your doctor need to be used regularly even if you have no symptoms. Wear eye protection. Serious eye injuries can lead to glaucoma. Wear eye protection when using power tools or playing high-speed racket sports in enclosed courts.",,"When to see a doctor, Promptly go to an emergency room or an eye doctor's office if you experience some of the symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma, such as severe headache, eye pain and blurred vision."

Using standardized growth charts, the measurement is compared with other children's measurements in percentiles. Some children just have small heads, whose measurement falls as low as the first percentile. In children with microcephaly, head size measures significantly below average, possibly even below the first percentile for your baby's age and sex. A child with more severe microcephaly may also have a backward-sloping forehead.","Microcephaly usually is the result of abnormal brain development, which can occur in the womb or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis. The premature fusing of the joints between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means your infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. If there are no underlying problems in the brain, this surgery allows the brain adequate space to grow and develop. Chromosomal abnormalities. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain . Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles, chickenpox and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these put your baby at risk of brain abnormalities. Severe malnutrition. Not getting adequate nutrition during pregnancy can affect your baby's development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria, also known as PKU, in the mother. PKU is a birth defect that hampers the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine.","Some children with microcephaly are of normal intelligence and development, even though their heads will always be small for their age and sex. But depending on the cause and severity of the microcephaly, complications may include: Developmental delays, such as in speech and movement, Difficulties with coordination and balance, Dwarfism or short stature, Facial distortions, Hyperactivity, Intellectual disabilities, Seizures","Learning your child has microcephaly can raise questions about future pregnancies. Work with your doctor to determine the cause of the microcephaly. If the cause is genetic, you and may want to talk to a genetics counselor about the risk of microcephaly in future pregnancies.",,"When to see a doctor, Chances are your doctor will detect microcephaly at the baby's birth or at a regular well-baby checkup.

A child often avoids using the arm and holds it slightly flexed next to the body. Sometimes, the elbow is only partially dislocated. Partial dislocation can cause bruising and pain where the ligaments were stretched or torn.","In adults, the most common causes of a dislocated elbow include: Falls. Falling onto an outstretched hand can pop the upper arm bone out of alignment within the elbow joint. Motor vehicle accidents. The same type of impact can occur when passengers in motor vehicle accidents reach forward to brace themselves before a collision. In children or teenagers, falling onto an outstretched hand is also a common cause of a dislocated elbow. In toddlers, the injury often occurs when an extra pulling motion is applied to an outstretched arm. The causes of such injuries include: Improper lifting. Trying to lift or swing a young child by the arms can cause the elbow to dislocate. Sudden pulling. Having the child suddenly step off a curb or stairstep as you're holding his or her hand can pull the elbow out of alignment.","Age. Young children's elbows are much more flexible than those of adults. So it's easier for younger elbows to become dislocated. Heredity. Some people are born with elbow ligaments that are looser than those of most people. Sports participation. Many elbow dislocations are sports-related. Sports that require weight bearing with the arms, such as gymnastics floor exercise, are especially risky for elbow dislocations.","Complications of a dislocated elbow can include: Fracture. The force that dislocates the elbow might also cause a fracture in one of the elbow bones. Pinched nerves. Rarely, nerves that travel across the elbow can become pinched or trapped between the dislocated bones or within the joint when the bones are realigned. Pinched nerves can cause numbness in the arm and hand. Trapped arteries. Rarely, blood vessels that supply the arm and hand can become pinched or trapped between the dislocated bones or within the realigned joint. Lack of blood supply can cause severe pain and permanent tissue damage in the arm and hand. Avulsion fractures. In some elbow dislocations, a stretched ligament will pull off a tiny bit of bone from its attachment point. This type of damage is more common in children. Osteoarthritis. The dislocated joint may be at higher risk of developing osteoarthritis in the future.",Avoid lifting or swinging small children by their arms.,"When to see a doctor, Seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has extreme pain or obvious distortion of the elbow joint."

As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens and distorts the light passing through the lens. This may lead to more noticeable symptoms.","Most cataracts develop when aging or injury changes the tissue that makes up your eye's lens. Some inherited genetic disorders that cause other health problems can increase your risk of cataracts. Cataracts can also be caused by other eye conditions, past eye surgery or medical conditions such as diabetes. Long-term use of steroid medications, too, can cause cataracts to develop. How a cataract forms, The lens, where cataracts form, is positioned behind the colored part of your eye . The lens focuses light that passes into your eye, producing clear, sharp images on the retina — the light-sensitive membrane in the eye that functions like the film in a camera. As you age, the lenses in your eyes become less flexible, less transparent and thicker. Age-related and other medical conditions cause tissues within the lens to break down and clump together, clouding small areas within the lens. As the cataract continues to develop, the clouding becomes denser and involves a bigger part of the lens. A cataract scatters and blocks the light as it passes through the lens, preventing a sharply defined image from reaching your retina. As a result, your vision becomes blurred. Cataracts generally develop in both eyes, but not evenly. The cataract in one eye may be more advanced than the other, causing a difference in vision between eyes. Types of cataracts, Cataract types include: Cataracts affecting the center of the lens . A nuclear cataract may at first cause more nearsightedness or even a temporary improvement in your reading vision. But with time, the lens gradually turns more densely yellow and further clouds your vision. As the cataract slowly progresses, the lens may even turn brown. Advanced yellowing or browning of the lens can lead to difficulty distinguishing between shades of color., Cataracts that affect the edges of the lens . A cortical cataract begins as whitish, wedge-shaped opacities or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As it slowly progresses, the streaks extend to the center and interfere with light passing through the center of the lens. Cataracts that affect the back of the lens . A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small, opaque area that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often interferes with your reading vision, reduces your vision in bright light, and causes glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to progress faster than other types do., Cataracts you're born with . Some people are born with cataracts or develop them during childhood. These cataracts may be genetic, or associated with an intrauterine infection or trauma. These cataracts also may be due to certain conditions, such as myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. Congenital cataracts don't always affect vision, but if they do they're usually removed soon after detection.","Factors that increase your risk of cataracts include: Increasing age, Diabetes, Excessive exposure to sunlight, Smoking, Obesity, High blood pressure, Previous eye injury or inflammation, Previous eye surgery, Prolonged use of corticosteroid medications, Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol","No studies have proved how to prevent cataracts or slow the progression of cataracts. But doctors think several strategies may be helpful, including: Have regular eye examinations. Eye examinations can help detect cataracts and other eye problems at their earliest stages. Ask your doctor how often you should have an eye examination. Quit smoking. Ask your doctor for suggestions about how to stop smoking. Medications, counseling and other strategies are available to help you. Manage other health problems. Follow your treatment plan if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that can increase your risk of cataracts., Choose a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables. Adding a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables to your diet ensures that you're getting many vitamins and nutrients. Fruits and vegetables have many antioxidants, which help maintain the health of your eyes. Studies haven't proved that antioxidants in pill form can prevent cataracts. But, a large population study recently showed that a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts. Fruits and vegetables have many proven health benefits and are a safe way to increase the amount of minerals and vitamins in your diet., Wear sunglasses. Ultraviolet light from the sun may contribute to the development of cataracts. Wear sunglasses that block ultraviolet B rays when you're outdoors. Reduce alcohol use. Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of cataracts.",,"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment for an eye exam if you notice any changes in your vision. If you develop sudden vision changes, such as double vision or flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or sudden headache, see your doctor right away."

Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous to yourself or others. Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning.

Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk.

33026,15584,febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome,,,"Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) describes an explosive-onset, potentially fatal acute epileptic encephalopathy that develops in previously healthy children and adolescents following the onset of a non-specific febrile illness.","This syndrome describes an explosive-onset, potentially fatal acute epileptic encephalopathy that develops in previously healthy children and adolescents following the onset of a non-specific febrile illness. Usually presents in 3-15 year olds that have previously been healthy and developmentally normal. It always comes after a simple febrile illness. Manifestations include the sudden onset of convulsive and recurrent focal seizures. This is followed by refractory focal epilepsy along with a decline in memory and cognition. Psychiatric disorders and occasionally motor disability can be present in some cases. In serious cases, the disease progression can lead to a vegetative or semi-conscious state or even death. There may be a genetic cause for the disease, as seen in Dravet syndrome, but as yet no causative genes have been identified.","A rare, potentially fatal , epileptic encephalopathy characterized by explosive-onset of recurrent multifocal and bilateral tonic-clonic seizures following an unspecific febrile illness. The syndrome develops without a clear acute structural, toxic or metabolic cause, in a patient without previous epilepsy. FIRES is a subgroup of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), and requires a preceding febrile infection as a mandatory feature.",1-9/100000,"In Germany, the prevalence is estimated at 1/100000 and annual incidence at 1/1000000 in children and adolescents. For adults, prevalence and incidence are unknown. In pediatric cases there is a male predominance, while females seem to be more frequently affected in adulthood. Familial cases have not been reported.","Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is most common in school-age children. Typically, a previously healthy individual manifests with a sudden onset of recurrent multifocal and bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, following an unspecific febrile illness. Refractory, and usually superrefractory, status epilepticus develops. The acute phase can last for weeks or months. A chronic phase follows, without a latent period, characterized by refractory focal epilepsy along with, often severe, impairments in memory, cognition and behavior. Motor disability is less common.","Monitoring in intensive care during the acute phase is mandatory. Anti-seizure medications are often ineffective. High-dose benzodiazepines can have a transient efficacy. Usually, general anesthesia with barbiturates (titrated to burst suppression) are needed to stop seizures, even if prolonged burst-suppression can be associated with a worse cognitive outcome. Recurrence is common on awakening, necessitating repeated anesthesia. Immune therapy is usually disappointing but anakinra or tocilizumab has been highly effective in a few cases. So far, the ketogenic diet has seemed most beneficial, especially if initiated early, but no controlled trials exist. Ketamine, inhalation anesthetics, cannabidiol, hypothermia and neurostimulation have shown transient efficacy in a few cases.","Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous to yourself or others. Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have epilepsy, you're 15 to 19 times more likely to drown while swimming or bathing than the rest of the population because of the possibility of having a seizure while in the water., Car accidents. A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Many states have driver's license restrictions related to a driver's ability to control seizures and impose a minimum amount of time that a driver be seizure-free, ranging from months to years, before being allowed to drive., , Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor as you plan your pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies. You'll need to be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, and medications may need to be adjusted.

38815,20070,neonatal epilepsy syndrome,,,,,,,,,,"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous to yourself or others. Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have epilepsy, you're 15 to 19 times more likely to drown while swimming or bathing than the rest of the population because of the possibility of having a seizure while in the water., Car accidents. A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Many states have driver's license restrictions related to a driver's ability to control seizures and impose a minimum amount of time that a driver be seizure-free, ranging from months to years, before being allowed to drive., , Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor as you plan your pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies. You'll need to be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, and medications may need to be adjusted. It's very important that you work with your doctor to plan your pregnancy., , Emotional health issues. People with epilepsy are more likely to have psychological problems, especially depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects. Other life-threatening complications of epilepsy are uncommon, but may happen, such as: Status epilepticus. This condition occurs if you're in a state of continuous seizure activity lasting more than five minutes or if you have frequent recurrent seizures without regaining full consciousness in between them. People with status epilepticus have an increased risk of permanent brain damage and death., , Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy . People with epilepsy also have a small risk of sudden unexpected death. The cause is unknown, but some research shows it may occur due to heart or respiratory conditions. People with frequent tonic-clonic seizures or people whose seizures aren't controlled by medications may be at higher risk of SUDEP.

98717,19770,X-linked dominant intellectual disability-epilepsy syndrome,,,,,,,,,,"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition.

Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury.

28680,32714,"facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, intellectual/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth syndrome",,,,,,,,,,"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include: Temporary confusion, A staring spell, Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs, Loss of consciousness or awareness, Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu, Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures, When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. During a complex partial seizure, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles. Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures, Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist. Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children and are characterized by staring into space or subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. These seizures may occur in clusters and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of your muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control, which may cause you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of your arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure and can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking, and sometimes loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.","Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Genetic influence. Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure you experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures., Head trauma. Head trauma as a result of a car accident or other traumatic injury can cause epilepsy. Brain conditions. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Stroke is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults older than age 35. Infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy. Prenatal injury. Before birth, babies are sensitive to brain damage that could be caused by several factors, such as an infection in the mother, poor nutrition or oxygen deficiencies. This brain damage can result in epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Developmental disorders. Epilepsy can sometimes be associated with developmental disorders, such as autism and neurofibromatosis.","Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Age. The onset of epilepsy is most common in children and older adults, but the condition can occur at any age. Family history. If you have a family history of epilepsy, you may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. Head injuries. Head injuries are responsible for some cases of epilepsy. You can reduce your risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. Stroke and other vascular diseases. Stroke and other blood vessel diseases can lead to brain damage that may trigger epilepsy. You can take a number of steps to reduce your risk of these diseases, including limiting your intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Dementia. Dementia can increase the risk of epilepsy in older adults. Brain infections. Infections such as meningitis, which causes inflammation in your brain or spinal cord, can increase your risk. Seizures in childhood. High fevers in childhood can sometimes be associated with seizures. Children who have seizures due to high fevers generally won't develop epilepsy. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","Having a seizure at certain times can lead to circumstances that are dangerous to yourself or others. Falling. If you fall during a seizure, you can injure your head or break a bone. Drowning. If you have epilepsy, you're 15 to 19 times more likely to drown while swimming or bathing than the rest of the population because of the possibility of having a seizure while in the water., Car accidents. A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Many states have driver's license restrictions related to a driver's ability to control seizures and impose a minimum amount of time that a driver be seizure-free, ranging from months to years, before being allowed to drive., , Pregnancy complications. Seizures during pregnancy pose dangers to both mother and baby, and certain anti-epileptic medications increase the risk of birth defects. If you have epilepsy and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor as you plan your pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies. You'll need to be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, and medications may need to be adjusted. It's very important that you work with your doctor to plan your pregnancy., , Emotional health issues. People with epilepsy are more likely to have psychological problems, especially depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Problems may be a result of difficulties dealing with the condition itself as well as medication side effects. Other life-threatening complications of epilepsy are uncommon, but may happen, such as: Status epilepticus. This condition occurs if you're in a state of continuous seizure activity lasting more than five minutes or if you have frequent recurrent seizures without regaining full consciousness in between them. People with status epilepticus have an increased risk of permanent brain damage and death., , Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy . People with epilepsy also have a small risk of sudden unexpected death. The cause is unknown, but some research shows it may occur due to heart or respiratory conditions. People with frequent tonic-clonic seizures or people whose seizures aren't controlled by medications may be at higher risk of SUDEP. Overall, about 1 percent of people with epilepsy die of SUDEP.",,"When to see a doctor, Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs: The seizure lasts more than five minutes. Breathing or consciousness doesn't return after the seizure stops. A second seizure follows immediately. You have a high fever. You're experiencing heat exhaustion. You're pregnant. You have diabetes. You've injured yourself during the seizure. If you experience a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice."

Infants who are affected by the condition generally appear healthy with no suspicious signs and symptoms prior to the incident. It is the leading cause of death in infants age 1 to 12 months old. The exact underlying cause of SIDS is unknown; however, scientists suspect that it is likely a multifactorial condition (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors). Although there is no guaranteed way to prevent SIDS, the American Academy of Pediatrics has a published list of recommendationsfor risk reduction. Please click on the link to access this resource.","The abrupt and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant under one year of age, remaining unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. :677-84)",,,,,,"A combination of physical and sleep environmental factors can make an infant more vulnerable to SIDS. These factors vary from child to child. Physical factors, Physical factors associated with SIDS include: Brain defects. Some infants are born with problems that make them more likely to die of SIDS. In many of these babies, the portion of the brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep hasn't matured enough to work properly. Low birth weight. Premature birth or being part of a multiple birth increases the likelihood that a baby's brain hasn't matured completely, so he or she has less control over such automatic processes as breathing and heart rate. Respiratory infection. Many infants who died of SIDS had recently had a cold, which might contribute to breathing problems. Sleep environmental factors, The items in a baby's crib and his or her sleeping position can combine with a baby's physical problems to increase the risk of SIDS. Examples include: Sleeping on the stomach or side. Babies placed in these positions to sleep might have more difficulty breathing than those placed on their backs. Sleeping on a soft surface. Lying face down on a fluffy comforter, a soft mattress or a waterbed can block an infant's airway. Sharing a bed. While the risk of SIDS is lowered if an infant sleeps in the same room as his or her parents, the risk increases if the baby sleeps in the same bed with parents, siblings or pets. Overheating. Being too warm while sleeping can increase a baby's risk of SIDS.","Although sudden infant death syndrome can strike any infant, researchers have identified several factors that might increase a baby's risk. They include: Sex. Boys are slightly more likely to die of SIDS. Age. Infants are most vulnerable between the second and fourth months of life. Race. For reasons that aren't well-understood, nonwhite infants are more likely to develop SIDS. Family history. Babies who've had siblings or cousins die of SIDS are at higher risk of SIDS. Secondhand smoke. Babies who live with smokers have a higher risk of SIDS. Being premature. Both being born early and having a low birth weight increase your baby's chances of SIDS. Maternal risk factors, During pregnancy, the mother also affects her baby's risk of SIDS, especially if she: Is younger than 20, Smokes cigarettes, Uses drugs or alcohol, Has inadequate prenatal care","There's no guaranteed way to prevent SIDS, but you can help your baby sleep more safely by following these tips: Back to sleep. Place your baby to sleep on his or her back, rather than on the stomach or side, every time you — or anyone else — put the baby to sleep for the first year of life. This isn't necessary when your baby's awake or able to roll over both ways without help. Don't assume that others will place your baby to sleep in the correct position — insist on it. Advise sitters and child care providers not to use the stomach position to calm an upset baby., Keep the crib as bare as possible. Use a firm mattress and avoid placing your baby on thick, fluffy padding, such as lambskin or a thick quilt. Don't leave pillows, fluffy toys or stuffed animals in the crib. These can interfere with breathing if your baby's face presses against them. Don't overheat your baby. To keep your baby warm, try a sleep sack or other sleep clothing that doesn't require additional covers. Don't cover your baby's head., Have your baby sleep in in your room. Ideally, your baby should sleep in your room with you, but alone in a crib, bassinet or other structure designed for infant sleep, for at least six months, and, if possible, up to a year. Adult beds aren't safe for infants. A baby can become trapped and suffocate between the headboard slats, the space between the mattress and the bed frame, or the space between the mattress and the wall. A baby can also suffocate if a sleeping parent accidentally rolls over and covers the baby's nose and mouth., Breast-feed your baby, if possible. Breast-feeding for at least six months lowers the risk of SIDS. Don't use baby monitors and other commercial devices that claim to reduce the risk of SIDS. The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of monitors and other devices because of ineffectiveness and safety issues., Offer a pacifier. Sucking on a pacifier without a strap or string at naptime and bedtime might reduce the risk of SIDS. One caveat — if you're breast-feeding, wait to offer a pacifier until your baby is 3 to 4 weeks old and you've settled into a nursing routine. If your baby's not interested in the pacifier, don't force it. Try again another day. If the pacifier falls out of your baby's mouth while he or she is sleeping, don't pop it back in., Immunize your baby. There's no evidence that routine immunizations increase SIDS risk. Some evidence indicates immunizations can help prevent SIDS.",,,

In this type of cardiomyopathy, the pumping ability of your heart's main pumping chamber — the left ventricle — becomes enlarged and can't effectively pump blood out of the heart. Although this type can affect people of all ages, it occurs most often in middle-aged people and is more likely to affect men. The most common cause is coronary artery disease or heart attack. However, it can also be caused by genetic defects., , Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This type involves abnormal thickening of your heart muscle, which makes it harder for the heart to work. It mostly affects the muscle of your heart's main pumping chamber . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can develop at any age, but the condition tends to be more severe if it occurs during childhood. Most people with this type of cardiomyopathy have a family history of the disease. Some genetic mutations have been linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy., , Restrictive cardiomyopathy. In this type, the heart muscle becomes stiff and less flexible, so it can't expand and fill with blood between heartbeats.

Your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Untreated, heart failure can be life-threatening. Blood clots. Because your heart can't pump effectively, blood clots might form in your heart. If clots enter your bloodstream, they can block the blood flow to other organs, including your heart and brain. Heart valve problems. Because cardiomyopathy causes the heart to enlarge, the heart valves might not close properly. This can cause blood to flow backward in the valve. Cardiac arrest and sudden death. Cardiomyopathy can trigger abnormal heart rhythms that cause fainting or, in some cases, sudden death if your heart stops beating effectively.","In many cases, you can't prevent cardiomyopathy.

The glomeruli filter your blood as it passes through your kidneys, separating things your body needs from those it doesn't. Healthy glomeruli keep blood protein — which is needed to maintain the right amount of fluid in your body — from seeping into your urine. When damaged, glomeruli allow too much blood protein to leave your body, leading to nephrotic syndrome. Many possible causes, Many diseases and conditions can cause glomerular damage and lead to nephrotic syndrome, including: Diabetic kidney disease. Diabetes can lead to kidney damage that affects the glomeruli. Minimal change disease. This is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Minimal change disease results in abnormal kidney function, but when the kidney tissue is examined under a microscope, it appears normal or nearly normal. The cause of the abnormal function typically can't be determined. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Characterized by scarring of some of the glomeruli, this condition can result from another disease, a genetic defect or certain medications or occur for no known reason. Membranous nephropathy. This kidney disorder is the result of thickening membranes within the glomeruli. The thickening is due to deposits made by the immune system. It can be associated with other medical conditions, such as lupus, hepatitis B, malaria and cancer, or it can occur for no known reason. Systemic lupus erythematosus. This chronic inflammatory disease can lead to serious kidney damage. Amyloidosis. This disorder occurs when amyloid proteins accumulate in your organs. Amyloid buildup often damages the kidneys' filtering system.","Factors that can increase your risk of nephrotic syndrome include: Medical conditions that can damage your kidneys. Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of developing nephrotic syndrome, such as diabetes, lupus, amyloidosis, reflux nephropathy and other kidney diseases. Certain medications. Medications that might cause nephrotic syndrome include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and drugs used to fight infections. Certain infections. Infections that increase the risk of nephrotic syndrome include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and malaria.","Possible complications of nephrotic syndrome include: Blood clots. The inability of the glomeruli to filter blood properly can lead to loss of blood proteins that help prevent clotting. This increases your risk of developing a blood clot in your veins. High blood cholesterol and elevated blood triglycerides. When the level of the protein albumin in your blood falls, your liver makes more albumin. At the same time, your liver releases more cholesterol and triglycerides. Poor nutrition. Loss of too much blood protein can result in malnutrition. This can lead to weight loss, which can be masked by edema. You may also have too few red blood cells, low blood protein levels and low levels of vitamin D. High blood pressure. Damage to your glomeruli and the resulting buildup of excess body fluid can raise your blood pressure. Acute kidney injury. If your kidneys lose their ability to filter blood due to damage to the glomeruli, waste products can build up quickly in your blood. If this happens, you might need emergency dialysis — an artificial means of removing extra fluids and waste from your blood — typically with an artificial kidney machine . Chronic kidney disease. Nephrotic syndrome can cause your kidneys to lose their function over time. If kidney function falls low enough, you might need dialysis or a kidney transplant. Infections. People with nephrotic syndrome have an increased risk of infections.",,"When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms that worry you."

Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the overgrowth. Although the signs and symptoms are unique for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include: Skin abnormalities. Most people with tuberous sclerosis have patches of light-colored skin, or they may develop small, harmless areas of thickened, smooth skin or reddish bumps under or around the nails. Facial growths that begin in childhood and resemble acne also are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be associated with seizures, which can be the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm shows up as repetitive spasms of the head and legs. Cognitive disabilities. Tuberous sclerosis can be associated with developmental delays and sometimes intellectual disability or learning disabilities. Mental health disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, also can occur. Behavioral problems. Common behavioral problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Most people with tuberous sclerosis develop noncancerous growths on their kidneys, and they may develop more growths as they age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as the child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or shortness of breath, especially with physical activity or exercise. These benign lung tumors occur more often in women than in men. Eye abnormalities. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye . These noncancerous growths don't always interfere with vision.",Signs and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth. Or the first signs and symptoms may become evident during childhood or even years later in adulthood. Contact your child's doctor if you're concerned about your child's development or you notice any of the signs or symptoms of tuberous sclerosis described above.,"Tuberous sclerosis can be the result of either: A random cell division error. About two-thirds of people who have tuberous sclerosis have a new mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene — the genes associated with tuberous sclerosis — and do not have a family history of tuberous sclerosis. Inheritance. About one-third of people who have tuberous sclerosis inherit an altered TSC1 or TSC2 gene from a parent who has the disorder. If you have tuberous sclerosis, you have up to a 50 percent chance of passing the condition to your biological children. Severity of the condition may vary. A parent with tuberous sclerosis may have a child who has a milder or more severe form of the disorder.","Depending on where the noncancerous growths, develop and their size, they can cause severe or life-threatening complications in people with tuberous sclerosis. Here are some examples of complications: Excess fluid in and around the brain. One type of brain growth can block the flow of cerebral spinal fluid within the brain. This blockage can cause the buildup of fluid in the cavities deep within the brain, a condition called hydrocephalus. Various signs and symptoms include an unexpectedly large head size, nausea, headaches and behavior changes. Heart complications. Growths in the heart, usually in infants, can block blood flow or cause problems with heart rhythm . Kidney damage. Growths in the kidney can be large and cause potentially serious — even life-threatening — kidney problems. Growths in the kidney can cause high blood pressure or bleeding or lead to kidney failure. Rarely, kidney growths can become cancerous. Lung failure. Growths in the lungs can lead to a collapsed lung or fluid around the lungs that interferes with lung function. Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Tuberous sclerosis is associated with an increased risk of developing malignant tumors in the kidneys and brain. Vison damage. Growths in the eye can interfere with vision if they block too much of the retina, though this is rare.",,"When to see a doctor, Signs and symptoms of tuberous sclerosis may be noticed at birth.

Potential complications may include: Fluid retention, which could lead to swelling in your arms and legs, high blood pressure, or fluid in your lungs, A sudden rise in potassium levels in your blood, which could impair your heart's ability to function and may be life-threatening, Heart and blood vessel disease, Weak bones and an increased risk of bone fractures, Anemia, Decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction or reduced fertility, Damage to your central nervous system, which can cause difficulty concentrating, personality changes or seizures, Decreased immune response, which makes you more vulnerable to infection, Pericarditis, an inflammation of the saclike membrane that envelops your heart, Pregnancy complications that carry risks for the mother and the developing fetus, Irreversible damage to your kidneys, eventually requiring either dialysis or a kidney transplant for survival","To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease: Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, follow the instructions on the package. Taking too many pain relievers could lead to kidney damage and generally should be avoided if you have kidney disease. Ask your doctor whether these drugs are safe for you. Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. Often this involves increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories. Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help you to stop. Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. If you have diseases or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney damage.","When to see a doctor, Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms of kidney disease.

Sometimes, a genetic mutation occurs on its own, so that neither parent has a copy of the mutated gene. The two main types of polycystic kidney disease, caused by different genetic flaws, are: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease . Signs and symptoms of ADPKD often develop between the ages of 30 and 40. In the past, this type was called adult polycystic kidney disease, but children can develop the disorder. Only one parent needs to have the disease for it to pass to the children. If one parent has ADPKD, each child has a 50% chance of getting the disease. This form accounts for most of the cases of polycystic kidney disease., ,, Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease . This type is far less common than is ADPKD. The signs and symptoms often appear shortly after birth. Sometimes, symptoms don't appear until later in childhood or during adolescence. Both parents must have abnormal genes to pass on this form of the disease. If both parents carry a gene for this disorder, each child has a 25% chance of getting the disease.","Complications associated with polycystic kidney disease include: High blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is a common complication of polycystic kidney disease. Untreated, high blood pressure can cause further damage to your kidneys and increase your risk of heart disease and strokes., Loss of kidney function. Progressive loss of kidney function is one of the most serious complications of polycystic kidney disease. Nearly half of those with the disease have kidney failure by age 60. PKD can interfere with the ability of your kidneys to keep wastes from building to toxic levels, a condition called uremia. As the disease worsens, end-stage kidney disease may result, necessitating ongoing kidney dialysis or a transplant to prolong your life., Chronic pain. Pain is a common symptom for people with polycystic kidney disease. It often occurs in your side or back. The pain can also be associated with a urinary tract infection, a kidney stone or a malignancy. Growth of cysts in the liver. The likelihood of developing liver cysts for someone with polycystic kidney disease increases with age. While both men and women develop cysts, women often develop larger cysts. Female hormones and multiple pregnancies might contribute to liver cyst development. Development of an aneurysm in the brain. A balloon-like bulge in a blood vessel in your brain can cause bleeding if it ruptures. People with polycystic kidney disease have a higher risk of aneurysms. People with a family history of aneurysms seem to be at highest risk. Ask your doctor if screening is needed in your case. If screening reveals that you don't have an aneurysm, your doctor may recommend repeating the screening exam in a few years or after several years as a follow-up. The timing of repeat screening depends on your risk. Pregnancy complications. Pregnancy is successful for most women with polycystic kidney disease. In some cases, however, women may develop a life-threatening disorder called preeclampsia. Those most at risk have high blood pressure or a decline in kidney function before they become pregnant. Heart valve abnormalities. As many as 1 in 4 adults with polycystic kidney disease develops mitral valve prolapse. When this happens, the heart valve no longer closes properly, which allows blood to leak backward. Colon problems. Weaknesses and pouches or sacs in the wall of the colon may develop in people with polycystic kidney disease.","If you have polycystic kidney disease and you're considering having children, a genetic counselor can help you assess your risk of passing the disease to your offspring. Keeping your kidneys as healthy as possible may help prevent some of the complications of this disease. One of the most important ways you can protect your kidneys is by managing your blood pressure. Here are some tips for keeping your blood pressure in check: Take the blood pressure medications prescribed by your doctor as directed. Eat a low-salt diet containing plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Maintain a healthy weight. Ask your doctor what the right weight is for you. If you smoke, quit. Exercise regularly. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week. Limit alcohol use.",,"When to see a doctor, It's not uncommon for people to have polycystic kidney disease for years without knowing it. If you develop some of the signs and symptoms of polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor. If you have a first-degree relative — parent, sibling or child — with polycystic kidney disease, see your doctor to discuss screening for this disorder."

A sign of a number of neurological disorders, ataxia can cause: Poor coordination, Unsteady walk and a tendency to stumble, Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt, Change in speech, Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements, Difficulty swallowing","Damage, degeneration or loss of nerve cells in the part of your brain that controls muscle coordination, results in ataxia. Your cerebellum comprises two portions of folded tissue situated at the base of your brain near your brainstem. This area of the brain helps with balance as well as eye movements, swallowing and speech. Diseases that damage the spinal cord and peripheral nerves that connect your cerebellum to your muscles also can cause ataxia. Ataxia causes include: Head trauma. Damage to your brain or spinal cord from a blow to your head, such as might occur in a car accident, can cause acute cerebellar ataxia, which comes on suddenly. Stroke. Either a blockage or bleeding in the brain can cause ataxia. When the blood supply to a part of your brain is interrupted or severely reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, brain cells die. Cerebral palsy. This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements. Autoimmune diseases. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. Infections. Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox and other viral infections such as HIV and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the ataxia resolves over time. Paraneoplastic syndromes. These are rare, degenerative disorders triggered by your immune system's response to a cancerous tumor, most commonly from lung, ovarian, breast or lymphatic cancer. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed. Abnormalities in the brain. An infected area in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, cancerous or noncancerous, can damage the cerebellum., Toxic reaction. Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy. Vitamin B-6 toxicity also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because the effects are often reversible. Also, some medications you take can cause problems as you age, so you might need to reduce your dose or discontinue the medication. Alcohol and drug intoxication; heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury; and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia., Vitamin E, vitamin B-12 or thiamine deficiency. Not getting enough of these nutrients, because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol misuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia. Thyroid problems. Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia. COVID-19 infection. This infection may cause ataxia, most commonly in very severe cases. For some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found. Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder. Hereditary ataxias, Some types of ataxia and some conditions that cause ataxia are hereditary. If you have one of these conditions, you were born with a defect in a certain gene that makes abnormal proteins. The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in your cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. As the disease progresses, coordination problems worsen. You can inherit a genetic ataxia from either a dominant gene from one parent or a recessive gene from each parent . In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder, so there might be no obvious family history. Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. Each type causes poor coordination, but each has specific signs and symptoms. Autosomal dominant ataxias, These include: Spinocerebellar ataxias. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, but other signs and symptoms, as well as age of onset, differ depending on the specific gene mutation. Episodic ataxia . There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. EA1 and EA2 are the most common. EA1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching. EA2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. You might have dizziness, fatigue and muscle weakness during your episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms might respond to medication. Autosomal recessive ataxias, These include: Friedreich's ataxia. This common hereditary ataxia involves damage to your cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry signals from your brain and spinal cord to your muscles. In most cases, signs and symptoms appear well before age 25. The rate of disease progression varies. The first indication generally is difficulty walking . The condition typically progresses to the arms and trunk. Muscles weaken and waste away over time, causing deformities, particularly in your feet, lower legs and hands. Other signs and symptoms that might develop as the disease progresses include slow, slurred speech ; fatigue; rapid, involuntary eye movements ; spinal curvature ; hearing loss; and heart disease, including heart enlargement and heart failure. Early treatment of heart problems can improve quality of life and survival., , Ataxia-telangiectasia. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. The disease also causes immune system breakdown, which increases susceptibility to other diseases, including infections and tumors. It affects various organs. Telangiectasia is the formation of tiny red ""spider"" veins that might appear in the corners of your child's eyes or on the ears and cheeks. Delayed motor skill development, poor balance and slurred speech are typically the first indications of the disease. Recurrent sinus and respiratory infections are common. Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung disease., Congenital cerebellar ataxia. This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth. Wilson's disease. People with this condition accumulate copper in their brains, livers and other organs, which can cause neurological problems, including ataxia. Early identification of this disorder can lead to treatment that will slow progression.",,,,"When to see a doctor, If you aren't aware of having a condition that causes ataxia, such as multiple sclerosis, see your doctor as soon as possible if you: Lose balance, Lose muscle coordination in a hand, arm or leg, Have difficulty walking, Slur your speech, Have difficulty swallowing"

32254,19497,nonsyndromic genetic deafness,,,A disease characterized by hearing loss that is not part of a larger syndrome.,Hearing loss resulting from damage to the cochlea and the sensorineural elements which lie internally beyond the oval and round windows. These elements include the auditory nerve and its connections in the brainstem.,"Deafness is the most frequent form of sensorial deficit. In the vast majority of cases, the deafness is termed nonsyndromic or isolated and the hearing loss is the only clinical anomaly reported. In developed counties, 60-80% of cases of early-onset hearing loss are of genetic origin.",,Between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 700 children were born with profound or severe hearing loss.,"The majority of cases presenting at birth concern perceptive deafness (with a neurosensory origin associated with the inner ear) rather than conductive deafness (anomalies in the amplification of sound waves between the middle ear - tympanum and auditory ossicles - and the outer ear). Autosomal dominant forms are characterised by very early onset and bilateral hearing loss with varying degrees of severity (ranging from mild to profound). No malformations of the inner ear can be detected by CT scan. Mutations in the PDS gene are responsible for 7% of cases of childhood deafness. In these cases, the deafness is marked by early-onset, usually bilateral (but sometimes asymmetric) hearing loss with autosomal recessive transmission. This form of deafness is always associated with malformations of the inner ear that can be detected by CT scan. In rare cases, thyroid gland disease may also be present. For the autosomal dominant forms of deafness, mutations in the COCH gene result in progressive postlingual deafness associated with severe attacks of vertigo and subjective tinnitus. This form of deafness should be distinguished from Meniere's disease (see this term). Autosomal dominant mutations in the WFS1 gene cause either a form of hearing loss affecting mainly low frequency sounds or deafness associated with optic atrophy.","Management should be multidisciplinary (involving a paediatrician, general practitioner, ORL specialist, speech therapist and hearing aid specialist). Hearing aids (either implanted or external) generally provide the only management option for improving hearing loss, although surgical treatment may sometimes be proposed for some forms of conductive hearing loss.",,,,,,
